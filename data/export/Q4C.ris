AB  - The online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) has been used for training without retraining the ELM when a chunk of data is received. However, OS-ELM may be affected by an improper number of hidden nodes settings which reduces the generalization of OS-ELM. This paper addresses this problem in OS-ELM. A new structural tolerance OS-ELM (STOS-ELM), based on the Householder block exact inverse QRD recursive least squares algorithm having numerical robustness is proposed. Experimental results conducted on four regressions and five classification problems showed that STOS-ELM can handle the situation when the network is constructed with an improper number of hidden nodes. Accordingly, the proposed STOS-ELM can be easily applied; the size of the hidden layer of ELM can be roughly approximated. If a chunk of data is received, it can be updated in the existing network without having to worry about the proper number of given hidden nodes. Furthermore, the accuracy of the network trained by STOS-ELM is comparable to that of the batch ELM when the networks have the same configurations. STOS-ELM can also be applied in ensemble version (ESTOS-ELM). We found that the stability of STOS-ELM can be further improved using the ensemble technique. The results show that ESTOS-ELM is also more stable and accurate than both of the original OS-ELM and EOS-ELM, especially in the classification problems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate forecasting of wind speed is crucial for wind power management and power system operation. In this paper, a novel online method based on hybrid decomposition and Online Sequential Outlier Robust Extreme Learning Machine (OSORELM) is proposed for wind speed prediction in a multi-step fashion. The hybrid decomposition method is composed of variational mode decomposition algorithm, sample entropy approach and wavelet packet decomposition algorithm (VMD-SE-WPD), and the OSORELM is optimized by Crisscross optimization (CSO). In data pre-processing period, the wind speed is decomposed by the proposed hybrid VMD-SE-WPD, where the VMD is first applied to decompose the original wind speed into a set of sub-series. Then, all sub-series are analyzed by SE method, and the part of sub-series with high SE value is further decomposed by WPD. Lastly, all sub-series obtained from above are forecasted by OSORELM, and the results of all sub-series are generated to obtain the final prediction results of the wind speed. The experiment results show that the proposed forecasting model can greatly improve the performance of wind speed prediction. © 2018 IEEE.

T2  - Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing
AB  - Various data mining approaches are now available, which help in handling large static data sets, in spite of limited computational resources. However, these approaches lack in mining high-speed endless streams, as their learning procedure though simple require the entire training process to be repeated for each new arriving information instance. The main challenges while dealing with continuous data streams: they are of sizes many times greater than the available memory, are real-time, and the new instances should be inspected at most once, and predictions must be made. Another issue with continuous real-time data is changing of concepts with time, which is often called concept drift. This paper addresses the above stated problems, and provides a solution by proposing a real-time, scalable, and robust architecture. It is a general-purpose architecture, based on online machine learning, which efficiently logs and mines the stream data in a fault-tolerant manner. It consists of two frameworks: (1) Event aggregation framework, which reliably collects events and messages from multiple sources and ships them to a destination for processing (2) Real-time computation framework, which processes streams online for extraction of information patterns. It guarantees reliable processing of billions of messages per second. Furthermore, it facilitates the evaluation of the stream learning algorithms and offers change detection strategies to detect concept drifts. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.

TI  - A robust myoelectric pattern recognition using online sequential extreme learning machine for finger movement classification
AU  - Anam, K.

T2  - Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS
AB  - A robust myoelectric pattern-recognition-system requires a system that should work in the real application as good as in the laboratory. However, this demand should be handled properly and rigorously to achieve a robust myoelectric system. Electrode shift is an issue that usually emerges when dealing with robustness issue. In daily life, the placement of electrodes becomes a significant issue that can downgrade the performance of the system. This paper proposed a new way to overcome the robustness issue by conducting an update to the system to anticipate changes in the future such as electrode shift, improvement in muscle strength or any other issue. Such update will be used to generate an adaptation. The adaptation is done according to the user's need by employing an online sequential extreme learning (OS-ELM) to learn the training data chunk by chunk. OS-ELM enables the myoelectric system to learn from a small number of data to avoid cumbersome training process. The day-to-day experiment shows that the proposed system can maintain its performance on average accuracy around 85% whereas the non-adaptive system could not. © 2015 IEEE.

T2  - 2015 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Security, ICCCS 2015
AB  - In this paper, a robust blind color image watermarking technique using Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is proposed. Blue channel is utilized and transformed using DWT. Low frequency LL4 sub-band is used for watermark embedding. A variant of mini-batch machine learning algorithm i.e. OS-ELM is initially tuned with a fixed number of training data used in its initial phase and size of block of data learned by it in each step. The training data to OS-ELM is constructed by combining the quantized and desired LL4 sub-band coefficients of the DWT domain. A random key decides the starting watermark embedding position of the coefficients. Two binary images are used as watermark. The robustness towards common image processing attacks is enhanced using this process. Experimental results show that the extracted watermarks from watermarked and attacked images are similar to the original watermarks. Computed time spans for embedding and extraction are of the order of milliseconds, which is suitable for developing real time watermarking applications. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Online-sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) shows a good solution to online learning using extreme learning machine approach for single-hidden-layer feedforward network. However, the algorithm tends to be data-dependent, i.e. the bias values need to be adjusted depending on each particular problem. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to OS-ELM, which is referred to as robust OS-ELM (ROS-ELM). ROS-ELM has a systematic method to select the bias that allows the bias to be selected following the input weights. Hence, the proposed algorithm works well for every benchmark dataset. ROS-ELM has all the pros of OS-ELM, i.e. the capable of learning one-by-one, chunk-by-chunk with fixed or varying chunk size. Moreover, the performance of the algorithm is higher than OS-ELM and it produces a better generalization performance with benchmark dataseis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - To solve the online learning problem under the scenario of time-varying and containing outliers, this paper proposes an M-estimator and Variable Forgetting Factor based Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (VFF-M-OSELM). The VFF-M-OSELM is developed from the online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm and retains the same excellent sequential learning ability as it, it replaces the conventional Least-Squares (LS) cost function with a robust M-estimator based cost function to enhance the robustness of the learning model to outliers. Meanwhile, a new variable forgetting factor method is designed and incorporated in the VFF-M- OSELM to enhance further the dynamic tracking ability and adaptivity of the algorithm to time-varying system. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Designing a robust proppant detection and classification workflow using machine learning for subsurface fractured rock samples post hydraulic fracturing operations
AU  - Maity, D.

T2  - Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering
AB  - Hydraulic fracturing is a method of reservoir stimulation that enhances the effective permeability of tight unconventional reservoirs such as shale oil and gas. In typical hydraulic fracturing treatments, millions of gallons of water are pumped under pressure into rock formations deep below the earth's surface. Proppant particles such as sand are injected as part of the fracturing slurry to hold the hydraulic fractures open, or propped, after high-pressure water injection has ceased. Propped hydraulic fractures provide a conduit for long-term hydrocarbon production, thus being essential to commercial oil and gas production from shale reservoirs. The distribution of the proppant particles can be useful in understanding effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatments. It can also help identify both, unstimulated and under-stimulated zones within the reservoirs of interest. These proppant particles can be found in drilling fluid return or in cores, which can be sampled from subsurface. In this study, we highlight the design and development of artificial neural network based workflow that helps identify where proppant particles are located and classifies proppant and various particles of interest. In this study, these particles are limited to naturally occurring calcite or other minerals from subsurface rocks. Various features of interest that help with the classification process have been conceptualized and defined. This method has been verified using controlled test cases and validated using actual samples from subsurface. The designed ANN classifier has also been benchmarked with other classification methods including k-nearest neighbor, naïve-Bayes classifiers and Support vector machines. A workflow to process samples from subsurface and quantify proppant distribution for future test programs including potential real time applications has been proposed. Based on this workflow, we share proppant distribution from a Permian Basin case study. We have also compared proppant distribution using our proposed method with results from an independent workflow on a similar dataset, which does not utilize machine learning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Electrode shift of a prosthetic device is one of most challengeable problems in surface Electromyography (sEMG) based hand gesture recognition. Electrode shift is usually caused by repositioning, donning or doffing of a prosthetic device. Accuracy of gesture recognition may significantly drop since a pattern of collected signals may change after electrode shift. Although re-training a recognition system after every reposition is able to maintain accurate recognition, collecting labeled samples is inconvenient to users. In this paper, we apply an online semi-supervised learning in which a classifier is trained with a small amount of labeled samples and then is updated with unlabeled samples online to hand gesture recognition. A well-known online semi-supervised learning algorithm, online multi-channel semi-supervised growing neural gas (OSSMGNG) algorithm, is used in this preliminary study. OSSMGNG is compared with an intuitive method which learns from the initial label training set only in experiments. The data is collected from able-bodied individuals across three days for experiments. The results indicate OSSMGNG achieves a higher classification accuracy than others. It suggests that the online semi-supervised learning algorithm enhances robustness of hand gesture identification against electrode shift. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Identifying potential associations between drugs and targets is a critical prerequisite for modern drug discovery and repurposing. However, predicting these associations is difficult because of the limitations of existing computational methods. Most models only consider chemical structures and protein sequences, and other models are oversimplified. Moreover, datasets used for analysis contain only true-positive interactions, and experimentally validated negative samples are unavailable. To overcome these limitations, we developed a semi-supervised based learning framework called NormMulInf through collaborative filtering theory by using labeled and unlabeled interaction information. The proposed method initially determines similarity measures, such as similarities among samples and local correlations among the labels of the samples, by integrating biological information. The similarity information is then integrated into a robust principal component analysis model, which is solved using augmented Lagrange multipliers. Experimental results on four classes of drug-target interaction networks suggest that the proposed approach can accurately classify and predict drug-target interactions. Part of the predicted interactions are reported in public databases. The proposed method can also predict possible targets for new drugs and can be used to determine whether atropine may interact with alpha1B- and beta1- adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, the developed technique identifies potential drugs for new targets and can be used to assess whether olanzapine and propiomazine may target 5HT2B. Finally, the proposed method can potentially address limitations on studies of multitarget drugs and multidrug targets. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - SeedNet: Automatic Seed Generation with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Interactive Segmentation

T2  - Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
AB  - In this paper, we propose an automatic seed generation technique with deep reinforcement learning to solve the interactive segmentation problem. One of the main issues of the interactive segmentation problem is robust and consistent object extraction with less human effort. Most of the existing algorithms highly depend on the distribution of inputs, which differs from one user to another and hence need sequential user interactions to achieve adequate performance. In our system, when a user first specifies a point on the desired object and a point in the background, a sequence of artificial user input is automatically generated for precisely segmenting the desired object. The proposed system allows the user to reduce the number of input significantly. This problem is difficult to cast as a supervised learning problem because it is not possible to define globally optimal user input at some stage of the interactive segmentation task. Hence, we formulate automatic seed generation problem as Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then optimize it by reinforcement learning with Deep Q-Network (DQN). We train our network on the MSRA10K dataset and show that the network achieves notable performance improvement from inaccurate initial segmentation on both seen and unseen datasets. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Lunar and planetary rover driving operations are conducted by strategic path planning using orbital assets while tactically accounting for hazards and science targets within the field of view of the rover. Current approaches include a variety of automated and manual processes to plan and adapt rover driving paths while leveraging a science and operations backroom to support tactical decision making. While perception and machine learning algorithms that can improve detection of terrain hazards and science targets are increasingly being used for Mars rover missions, strategic and tactical path planning still require extensive human-in-the-loop interaction and have not been developed specifically for lunar applications. This paper outlines machine learning tools developed at Mission Control with the goal of safer and more efficient rover navigation and planning. 1) A data-driven approach to terramechanics modelling is increasingly being considered state-of-the-art as it can capture phenomena that are hard or impossible to capture by traditional physics-based approaches. Mission Control's Autonomous Soil Assessment System (ASAS) can update slip-slope models in real-time for a specific terrain class detected by an automated terrain classifier and can dynamically adapt to changing terrain properties. This offers greater safety in navigating through non-geometric hazards that can threaten the rover's mobility. 2) For skid-steer vehicles such as many proposed lunar rovers, power consumption is dependent on turn radius along with other factors such as terrain type and slope. Path planners that implement a power model to minimize path energy can thus increase driving efficiency. Mission Control's Skid-Steer Optimizer (SSO) technology uses a data-driven power model with a sampling-based path planner that produce lower-energy paths compared to traditional distance-optimized path planners. 3) To autonomously and dynamically predict terrain slip and power consumption on a planetary surface with different terrain types, Mission Control is developing an N-terrain visual terrain classifier that uses deep learning techniques with semantic segmentation. This classifier can also be leveraged to detect targets of interest for survey or collection. Mission Control is developing an Intelligent Path Planner that integrates the aforementioned technologies to plan trajectories that avoid terrain hazards, reduce power consumption, and increase mission yield. Updates on these developments will be presented, along with results from a recent field test campaign to demonstrate ASAS at a natural analogue test site at White Sands National Monument.

AB  - Protein complex prediction approaches are based on the assumptions that complexes have dense protein-protein interactions and high functional similarity between their subunits. We investigated those assumptions by studying the subunits' interaction topology, sequence similarity and molecular function for human and yeast protein complexes. Inclusion of amino acids' physicochemical properties can provide better understanding of protein complex properties. Principal component analysis is carried out to determine the major features. Adopting amino acid composition profile information with the SVM classifier serves as an effective post-processing step for complexes classification. Improvement is based on primary sequence information only, which is easy to obtain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AU  - Qiu, X.

T2  - Biometrics
AB  - In clinical practice, an informative and practically useful treatment rule should be simple and transparent. However, because simple rules are likely to be far from optimal, effective methods to construct such rules must guarantee performance, in terms of yielding the best clinical outcome (highest reward) among the class of simple rules under consideration. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the benefit of the derived rules on the whole sample and in pre-specified subgroups (e.g., vulnerable patients). To achieve both goals, we propose a robust machine learning method to estimate a linear treatment rule that is guaranteed to achieve optimal reward among the class of all linear rules. We then develop a diagnostic measure and inference procedure to evaluate the benefit of the obtained rule and compare it with the rules estimated by other methods. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed method and its inference procedure, and we demonstrate via simulations its superior performance when compared to existing methods. Lastly, we apply the method to the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial on major depressive disorder and show that the estimated optimal linear rule provides a large benefit for mildly depressed and severely depressed patients but manifests a lack-of-fit for moderately depressed patients. © 2017, The International Biometric Society

AB  - In this paper, we propose and analyze conservative value iteration, which unifies value iteration, soft value iteration, advantage learning, and dynamic policy programming. Our analysis shows that algorithms using a combination of gap-increasing and max operators are resilient to stochastic errors, but not to non-stochastic errors. In contrast, algorithms using a softmax operator without a gap-increasing operator are less susceptible to all types of errors, but may display poor asymptotic performance. Algorithms using a combination of gap-increasing and softmax operators are much more effective and may asymptotically outperform algorithms with the max operator. Not only do these theoretical results provide a deep understanding of various reinforcement learning algorithms, but they also highlight the effectiveness of gap-increasing operators, as well as the limitations of traditional greedy value updates by the max operator. © 2019 by the author(s).

AB  - Interactive reinforcement learning is an approach in which an external trainer helps an agent to learn through advice. A trainer is useful in large or continuous scenarios; however, when the characteristics of the environment change over time, it can affect the learning. Robust reinforcement learning is a reliable approach that allows an agent to learn a task, regardless of disturbances in the environment. In this work, we present an approach that addresses interactive reinforcement learning problems in a dynamic environment with continuous states and actions. Our results show that the proposed approach allows an agent to complete the cart-pole balancing task satisfactorily in a dynamic, continuous action-state domain.  © 2020 Owner/Author.

AB  - The effectiveness of machine learning (ML) approaches for machine fault diagnosis (MFD) has been proved in previous studies. The majority of the previous studies used simulation or laboratory datasets. However, the robustness of the ML models for (MFD) in real-world applications has rarely been discussed. In this work, we conducted an empirical study on the robustness of ML approaches in case of wheel flat (WF) detection for railway freight wagons. WF is a common failure on wheel tread surface, causing large impulsive impacts on vehicles and infrastructure. We made great efforts to collect and clean up the relevant field data that was measured on different freight wagons running with different faulty conditions on different lines at different speed ranges. The collected datasets can represent the complexity of real-world railway operational conditions. We build several baseline models, incorporating deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and different signal processing techniques for WF detection, in order to study their robustness against diverse conditional variations in practice. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Automated profiling of cell morphology is a powerful tool for inferring cell function. However, this technique retains a high barrier to entry. In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases and dependent on user experience. Here, we use interactive machine learning to identify the optimum cell profiling configuration that maximises quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. We use Bayesian optimisation, an established machine learning algorithm, to learn from this information and automatically recommend the next configuration to examine with the aim of maximising the quality of the processing or analysis. Compared to existing interactive machine learning tools that require domain expertise for per-class or per-pixel annotations, we rely on users’ explicit assessment of output quality of the cell profiling task at hand. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task using the standard software CellProfiler. Our toolkit enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, increasing the quality of object segmentation over a pipeline optimised through trial-and-error. Users also attested to the ease of use and reduced cognitive load enabled by our machine learning strategy over the standard approach. We envision that our interactive machine learning approach can enhance the quality and efficiency of pipeline optimisation to democratise image-based cell profiling. Copyright: © 2020 Laux et al.

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of complex vision-based sensing methods for use in obstacle identification and state estimation, characterizing environment-dependent measurement errors has become a difficult and essential part of modern robotics. This paper presents a self-supervised learning approach to safety-critical control. In particular, the uncertainty associated with stereo vision is estimated, and adapted online to new visual environments, wherein this estimate is leveraged in a safety-critical controller in a robust fashion. To this end, we propose an algorithm that exploits the structure of stereo-vision to learn an uncertainty estimate without the need for ground-truth data. We then robustify existing Control Barrier Function-based controllers to provide safety in the presence of this uncertainty estimate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a quadrupedal robot in a variety of environments. When not using our method safety is violated. With offline training alone we observe the robot is safe, but overly-conservative. With our online method the quadruped remains safe and conservatism is reduced. © 2022 IEEE.

T2  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
AB  - The tracking method based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) is efficient and effective. ELM randomly generates input weights and biases in the hidden layer, and then calculates and computes the output weights by reducing the iterative solution to the problem of linear equations. Therefore, ELM offers the satisfying classification performance and fast training time than other discriminative models in tracking. However, the original ELM method often suffers from the problem of the imbalanced classification distribution, which is caused by few target objects, leading to under-fitting and more background samples leading to over-fitting. Worse still, it reduces the robustness of tracking under special conditions including occlusion, illumination, etc. To address above problems, in this paper, we present a robust tracking algorithm. First, we introduce the local weight matrix that is the dynamic creation from the data distribution at the current frame in the original ELM so as to balance between the empirical and structure risk, and fully learn the target object to enhance the classification performance. Second, we improve it to the incremental learning method ensuring tracking real-time and efficient. Finally, the forgetting factor is used to strengthen the robustness for changing of the classification distribution with time. Meanwhile, we propose a novel optimized method to obtain the optimal sample as the target object, which avoids tracking drift resulting from noisy samples. Therefore, our tracking method can fully learn both of the target object and background information to enhance the tracking performance, and it is evaluated in 20 challenge image sequences with different attributes including illumination, occlusion, deformation, etc., which achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The efficient and effective management of hydropower reservoirs is vital for hydroelectric power plant operation. Therefore, accurate and reliable flow forecasting forms an important basis for efficient real-time hydropower reservoir operation. The inflow forecast modeling process involves various computations and modeling techniques, which results in uncertainties various factors. The inflow forecasting techniques also may vary with the purpose of the system, physical characteristics and availability of data. Over the decades, there is an increasing awareness of the risk of relying on a single model among researchers and practitioners. There is clearly a potential danger in relying entirely on one rainfall-runoff model in such systems, as each model, provides, through its forecast, an important source of information that may be different in some detail from those of the other models calibrated with the same data set. Moreover, the failure of the model to yield consistent and reasonably accurate forecasts may undermine its credibility and results in poor reservoir planning and operation. Hence, consideration of the development of more flexible inflow forecasting systems is needed. These will not be based on a single substantive rainfall-runoff model, but efficient utilization of the synchronous flow forecasts from several substantive rainfall-runoff models, each having different strengths and weaknesses, to produce improved forecasts. In this study, multi-model ensemble strategies will be developed by considering outputs from a committee of models. Multi-model ensemble methods using a machine-learning algorithm combining different model outputs to the water level forecasts will be applied. The performance of the different machine-learning algorithms against the component models and accuracy improvement will be investigated. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

The proposed RR-OSELM is able to learn the newly arrived samples incrementally by a recursive fashion, and assign inverse weights for each example based on the priori error so as to reduce its sensibility to outliers. The Tikhonov regularization technique is incorporated in the RR-OSELM to further enhance the stability of the algorithm in real applications. Experimental results show that the proposed RR-OSELM is more robust than its counterparts, and it can be applied to the online modeling and prediction of data streams with outliers. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of NUAA.

AB  - Training reinforcement learning agents in real-world environments is costly, particularly for safety-critical applications. Human input can enable an agent to learn a good policy while avoiding unsafe actions, but at the cost of bothering the human with repeated queries. We present a model for safe learning in safety-critical environments from human input that minimises bother cost. Our model, JPAL-HA, proposes an efficient mechanism to harness human preferences and justifications to significantly improve safety during the learning process without increasing the number of interactions with a user. We show this with both simulation and human experiments. © 2022 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org). All rights reserved.

TI  - Robust Dynamic Pricing in Online Markets with Reinforcement Learning

T2  - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)
AB  - In online markets, reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising way for dynamic pricing, due to its ability in maximizing long-term cumulative return. However, directly optimizing RL policies in the online markets can be costly since RL requires trial-and-error with the environment, which may lead to drastic revenue loss. In this paper, we propose a robust dynamic pricing algorithm using RL. The main idea is to train the dynamic pricing policy in an adversarial simulation environment built with a generative adversarial framework. In this framework, the generator is trained to: 1) imitate real customers behaviors; 2) generate adversarial behaviors. The algorithm is proved to converge under certain assumptions. The experiment results show that our algorithm can be comparable with the algorithm directly trained in the real environment. Moreover, it outperforms other baseline significantly in different scenarios. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

T2  - IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica
AB  - Electromyography (EMG) has already been broadly used in human-machine interaction (HMI) applications. Determining how to decode the information inside EMG signals robustly and accurately is a key problem for which we urgently need a solution. Recently, many EMG pattern recognition tasks have been addressed using deep learning methods. In this paper, we analyze recent papers and present a literature review describing the role that deep learning plays in EMG-based HMI. An overview of typical network structures and processing schemes will be provided. Recent progress in typical tasks such as movement classification, joint angle prediction, and force/torque estimation will be introduced. New issues, including multimodal sensing, inter-subject/inter-session, and robustness toward disturbances will be discussed. We attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of current research by discussing the advantages, challenges, and opportunities brought by deep learning. We hope that deep learning can aid in eliminating factors that hinder the development of EMG-based HMI systems. Furthermore, possible future directions will be presented to pave the way for future research. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.

AB  - As perhaps the primary conduit of the physical expression of human freedom of movement, transportation in its various forms plays a critical role in human society. The availability of ready transport has shaped the fabric, infrastructure, and, to some degree, even the culture of whole human society. Now, automated driving, in various forms of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and self-driving systems, is promising a safe, efficient, and productive life to humans by relieving driver from active driving tasks in the context of road transportation. However, recent high-profile crashes, e.g., fatalities involving Uber test autonomous vehicle or Tesla car, have undermined the automated-driving promise of enhanced safety. On the other hand, in automotive industry, there are safety approaches like ISO 26262 and others in-development which all are expected to mitigate the safety risk resulting from automated driving. This contribution firstly reviewed the emerging human-automation interaction issues relating to automated-driving safety. Then, with the respect to these issues, the relevant automotive safety approaches - ISO 26262, ISO 21448 (Safety of the Intended Functionality, SOTIF) and RSS (Responsibility-Sensitive Safety model), were discussed to highlight the blind spots in them which may impair the safety promise of automated driving where now machine learning mechanisms are prevalent. Next, we briefly introduced the system-thinking tools in human factors discipline which are expected to enhance automated-driving technology to address human-automation interaction issues. Finally, we concluded the findings and argued that automated-driving safety risks should be managed not only from technological perspective but also from human-factors perspective, and the philosophy of human use of driving automation can benefit the development of a safe, reliable, and trustworthy Automated Driving System (ADS). © 2021 SAE International.

TI  - High-Performance Visual Tracking with Extreme Learning Machine Framework
AU  - Deng, C.
AU  - Han, Y.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics
AB  - In real-time applications, a fast and robust visual tracker should generally have the following important properties: 1) feature representation of an object that is not only efficient but also has a good discriminative capability and 2) appearance modeling which can quickly adapt to the variations of foreground and backgrounds. However, most of the existing tracking algorithms cannot achieve satisfactory performance in both of the two aspects. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate a novel and efficient visual tracker by exploiting the excellent feature learning and classification capabilities of an emerging learning technique, that is, extreme learning machine (ELM). The contributions of the proposed work are as follows: 1) motivated by the simplicity and learning ability of the ELM autoencoder (ELM-AE), an ELM-AE-based feature extraction model is presented, and this model can provide a compact and discriminative representation of the inputs efficiently and 2) due to the fast learning speed of an ELM classifier, an ELM-based appearance model is developed for feature classification, and is able to rapidly distinguish the object of interest from its surroundings. In addition, in order to cope with the visual changes of the target and its backgrounds, the online sequential ELM is used to incrementally update the appearance model. Plenty of experiments on challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker. © 2013 IEEE.

T2  - 13th USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar 2019
AB  - In this paper, we describe an approach for clustering aircraft taxi trajectories on the airport surface. The resulting clusters can enable improved or novel analyses and optimization of airport surface traffic. In particular, we seek to identify anomalous taxi trajectories. While statistically anomalous trajectories may be planned or expected by a human controller, they may also be unplanned, and thus may represent flights that could pose safety risks. We developed a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups taxi paths in space and then in time. We present results for Charlotte Douglas International Airport (KCLT), showing the common taxi trajectories represented by the clusters, and then discuss leveraging those clusters to identify anomalous trajectories in this dataset. This unsupervised machine learning approach is able to successfully differentiate between typical and anomalous trajectories in a post hoc setting. We have begun to validate the anomalies with subject matter experts as being a combination of infrequently-used paths and true anomalies. In addition, by clustering in time the trajectories in a shape-based cluster, we can separate free-flowing trajectories from those with stops and identify some common stopping points. Finally, we identify numerous extensions of this approach, and other applications for the underlying clustering methodology. © 2019 EUROCONTROL. All rights reserved.

AU  - Hu, J.
AU  - Liu, Y.
T2  - AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum
AB  - UAS trajectory prediction is stochastic in nature and randomness exists in almost every aspect of UAS Traffic Management. In order to address this challenge, it is critical to ensure a reasonable separation between UAS and obstacles when doing path planning and conflict resolution. In this paper, a novel method to deconflict for rotary-wing UAS traffic management is proposed. The main idea is to integrate a probabilistic dynamic anisotropic operational safety bound as airspace reservation with reinforcement learning method. The operational safety bound is based on UAS performance, weather condition and uncertainties in UAS operations, such as positioning error. Based on the operational safety bound concept, a new reward function in reinforcement learning is developed. The proposed methodology results in a trajectory prediction model under risk-based dynamic separation criterion. The algorithm of Q learning is adopted to find the optimal path planning. Simulations of avoiding static obstacles and multi-UAS conflict resolution are conducted to show the deconflict capability. Comparisons between results with operational safety bound and without operational safety bound are shown and analyzed. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

T2  - Computers, Materials and Continua
AB  - The Hand Gestures Recognition (HGR) System can be employed to facilitate communication between humans and computers instead of using special input and output devices. These devices may complicate communication with computers especially for people with disabilities. Hand gestures can be defined as a natural human-to-human communication method, which also can be used in human-computer interaction. Many researchers developed various techniques and methods that aimed to understand and recognize specific hand gestures by employing one or two machine learning algorithms with a reasonable accuracy. Thiswork aims to develop a powerful hand gesture recognition model with a 100% recognition rate. We proposed an ensemble classification model that combines the most powerful machine learning classifiers to obtain diversity and improve accuracy. The majority voting method was used to aggregate accuracies produced by each classifier and get the final classification result. Our model was trained using a self-constructed dataset containing 1600 images of ten different hand gestures. The employing of canny's edge detector and histogram of oriented gradient method was a great combination with the ensemble classifier and the recognition rate. The experimental results had shown the robustness of our proposed model. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine have achieved 100% accuracy. The developed model was validated using two public datasets, and the findings have proved that our model outperformed other compared studies. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Batch-like online learning for more robust hybrid artificial intelligence: Deconstruction as a machine learning process
AU  - Schmid, T.
T2  - CEUR Workshop Proceedings
AB  - Continuous streams of data are a common, yet challenging phenomenon of modern information processing. Traditional approaches to adopt machine learning techniques to this setting, like offline and online learning, have demonstrated several critical drawbacks. In order to avoid known disadvantages of both approaches, we propose to combine their complementary advantages in a novel machine learning process called deconstruction. Similar to supervised and unsupervised learning, this novel process provides a fundamental learning functionality modeled after human learning. This functionality integrates mechanisms for partitioning training data, managing learned knowledge representations and integrating newly acquired knowledge with previously learned knowledge representations. A prerequisite for this concept is that learning data can be partitioned and that resulting knowledge partitions may be accessed by formal means. In the proposed approach, this is achieved by the recently introduced Constructivist Machine Learning framework, which allows to create, exploit and maintain a knowledge base. In this work, we highlight the design concepts for the implementation of such a deconstruction process. In particular, we describe required subprocesses and how they can be combined. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AU  - Jiang, H.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems
AB  - Researchers have made many attempts to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn to fly aircraft in recent years. However, existing RL strategies usually are not safe (e.g., can lead to crash) in the initial stage of the training of an RL-based policy. For increasingly complex piloting tasks whose representative models are hard to establish, it is not safe to apply the existing RL strategies to learn an RL-based policy by interacting with an aircraft. To enhance the safety and feasibility of applying an RL-based policy to an aircraft, this study develops an Offline-Online RL strategy. The Offline-Online RL strategy learns an effective initialization for an RL-based flight control policy from human pilots without interacting with an aircraft through offline RL. Then, the Offline-Online RL strategy can further improve the RL-based flight control policy safely without leading to crash by interacting with the aircraft according to regular online RL, requiring no or very little intervention performed by a human pilot. To demonstrate and evaluate the Offline-Online RL strategy, the strategy is utilized to address the stall recovery problem of aircraft based on a flight simulator. IEEE

AB  - With the increasing demand for web-based services and the growing amount of data generated and stored, data centers are becoming more vital for organizations of all sizes. Unfortunately, climate and abrupt weather changes can compromise data center conditions and cause costly and inconvenient performance issues. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain appropriate environmental conditions within data centers to ensure the equipment's safety and efficiency, as well as the comfort and safety of the workers. Monitoring and managing the temperature and relative humidity within a data center can minimize the risk of equipment failure and employee discomfort, ensuring the reliability and productivity of the facility. This paper examines machine-learning (ML) models' applicability for handling near-real-time emergency airflow control in data centers during extreme weather events. ML models are built in Python and evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination R2 metrics. In addition, energy plus simulates the environment of a data center. Finally, the data center cooler settings, IT equipment load level, and outdoor air conditions are used to manage the facility's requirements. The seventh-order polynomial model had the highest R2 score and the lowest errors during training and testing. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - How can decision analysts and risk analysts help to improve policy and decision-making when the correct probabilistic relation between alternative acts and their probable consequences is unknown? This practical challenge of risk management with model uncertainty arises in problems from preparing for climate change to managing emerging diseases to operating complex and hazardous facilities safely. This chapter discusses constructive methods for robust and adaptive risk analysis under deep uncertainty. These methods are not yet as familiar to many risk analysts as older statistical and model-based methods, such as the paradigm of identifying a single “best-fitting” model and performing sensitivity analyses for its conclusions. They provide genuine breakthroughs for improving predictions and decisions when the correct model is highly uncertain. We demonstrate their potential by summarizing a variety of practical risk management applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - EAGLE: Evasion Attacks Guided by Local Explanations against Android Malware Classification
AU  - Shu, Z.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing
AB  - With machine learning techniques widely used to automate Android malware detection, it is important to investigate the robustness of these methods against evasion attacks. A recent work has proposed a novel problem-space attack on Android malware classifiers, where adversarial examples are generated by transforming Android malware samples while satisfying practical constraints. Aimed to address its limitations, we propose a new attack called EAGLE (<bold>E</bold>vasion <bold>A</bold>ttacks <bold>G</bold>uided by <bold>L</bold>ocal <bold>E</bold>xplanations), whose key idea is to leverage local explanations to guide the search for adversarial examples. We present a generic algorithmic framework for EAGLE attacks, which can be customized with specific feature increase and decrease operations to evade Android malware classifiers trained on different types of count features. We overcome practical challenges in implementing these operations for four different types of Android malware classifiers. Using two Android malware datasets, our results show that EAGLE attacks can be highly effective at finding functionable adversarial examples. We study the attack transferrability of malware variants created by EAGLE attacks across classifiers built with different classification models or trained on different types of count features. Our research further demonstrates that ensemble classifiers trained from multiple types of count features are not immune to EAGLE attacks. We also discuss possible defense mechanisms against EAGLE attacks. IEEE

AB  - The electrical grid is a safety-critical system, since incorrect actions taken by a power system operator can result in grid failure and cause harm. For this reason, it is desirable to have an automated power system operator that can reliably take actions that avoid grid failure while fulfilling some objective. Given the existing and growing complexity of power system operation, the choice has often fallen on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents for automation, but these are neither explainable nor provably safe. Therefore in this work, the effect of shielding on DRL agent survivability, validation computational time, and convergence are explored. To do this, shielded and unshielded DRL agents are evaluated on a standard IEEE 14-bus network. Agents are tasked with balancing generation and demand through redispatch and topology changing actions at a human timescale of 5 minutes. To test survivability under controlled conditions, varying degrees of scheduled unavailability events are introduced which could cause grid failure if unaddressed. Results show improved convergence and generally greater survivability of shielded agents compared with unshielded agents. However, the safety assurances provided by the shield increase computational time. This will require trade-offs or optimizations to make real-time deployment more feasible. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In contrast to established safety-critical software components, we can neither prove nor assume that the outcomes of components containing models based on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) will be correct in any situation. Thus, uncertainty is an inherent part of decision-making when using the outcomes of data-driven models created by AI/ML algorithms. In order to deal with this - especially in the context of safety-related systems - we need to make uncertainty transparent via dependable statistical statements. This paper introduces both a conceptual model and the related mathematical foundation of an uncertainty wrapper solution for data-driven models. The wrapper enriches existing data-driven models such as provided by ML or other AI techniques with case-individual and sound uncertainty estimates. The task of traffic sign recognition is used to illustrate the approach, which considers uncertainty not only in terms of model fit but also in terms of data quality and scope compliance.

AB  - The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) components embedded in autonomous systems-so-called Learning-Enabled Systems (LESs)-has resulted in the pressing need to assure their functional safety. As for traditional functional safety, the emerging consensus within both, industry and academia, is to use assurance cases for this purpose. Typically assurance cases support claims of reliability in support of safety, and can be viewed as a structured way of organising arguments and evidence generated from safety analysis and reliability modelling activities. While such assurance activities are traditionally guided by consensus-based standards developed from vast engineering experience, LESs pose new challenges in safety-critical application due to the characteristics and design of ML models. In this article, we first present an overall assurance framework for LESs with an emphasis on quantitative aspects, e.g., breaking down system-level safety targets to component-level requirements and supporting claims stated in reliability metrics. We then introduce a novel model-agnostic Reliability Assessment Model (RAM) for ML classifiers that utilises the operational profile and robustness verification evidence. We discuss the model assumptions and the inherent challenges of assessing ML reliability uncovered by our RAM and propose solutions to practical use. Probabilistic safety argument templates at the lower ML component-level are also developed based on the RAM. Finally, to evaluate and demonstrate our methods, we not only conduct experiments on synthetic/benchmark datasets but also scope our methods with case studies on simulated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and physical Unmanned Ground Vehicles.

TI  - Safety-Integrated Online Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Energy Storage System Scheduling and Volt/VAR Control in Power Distribution Networks
AU  - Jeon, S

AU  - Choi, DH
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - In coupled power distribution and transportation (CPT) system, a joint scheduling framework for mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) and Volt/VAR control (VVC) ensures reliable power distribution grid operations while supporting electric vehicle loads at electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). However, conventional model-based optimization methods for MESS scheduling and VVC may yield suboptimal solutions and greater computation times because of MESS operation and VVC in uncertain environment of CPT systems. To resolve this issue, this study proposes a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. In this framework, smart inverters of MESSs and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems cooperate to minimize the real power loss and mitigate the violations of both MESSs' state of charge (SOC) and voltage in the power distribution network, while MESSs travel via the transportation network to satisfy EV loads at EVCSs. A MESS routing algorithm based on Dijkstra's algorithm is developed to determine the optimal destinations of the MESSs. In addition, two safety modules are developed to ensure that neither SOC nor voltage violations occur by adjusting real and/or reactive power of MESSs and PV systems during the training process. The developed MESS routing algorithm and safety modules are integrated into the proposed DRL framework, wherein the DRL agent performs the desired MESS scheduling and VVC through safe exploration during the training procedure. The proposed approach is tested in coupled IEEE 33-bus power distribution and 15-node transportation systems and coupled IEEE 57-bus power distribution and 42-node transportation systems. Numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of training convergence, real power loss, and SOC/voltage violation.

TI  - Bridging the Gap Between Ethics and Practice: Guidelines for Reliable, Safe, and Trustworthy Human-centered AI Systems
AU  - Ben Shneiderman
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB  - This article attempts to bridge the gap between widely discussed ethical principles of Human-centered AI (HCAI) and practical steps for effective governance. Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces:the safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations. and society.

AB  - PurposeRecent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, at its core, Machine Learning (ML) offer opportunities for organizations to develop new or enhance existing capabilities. Despite the endless possibilities, organizations face operational challenges in harvesting the value of ML-based capabilities (MLbC), and current research has yet to explicate these challenges and theorize their remedies. To bridge the gap, this study explored the current practices to propose a systematic way of orchestrating MLbC development, which is an extension of ongoing digitalization of organizations.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from Finland's Artificial Intelligence Accelerator (FAIA) and complemented by follow-up interviews with experts outside FAIA in Europe, China and the United States over four years. Data were analyzed through open coding, thematic analysis and cross-comparison to develop a comprehensive understanding of the MLbC development process.FindingsThe analysis identified the main components of MLbC development, its three phases (development, release and operation) and two major MLbC development challenges: Temporal Complexity and Context Sensitivity. The study then introduced Fostering Temporal Congruence and Cultivating Organizational Meta-learning as strategic practices addressing these challenges.Originality/valueThis study offers a better theoretical explanation for the MLbC development process beyond MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) and its hindrances. It also proposes a practical way to align ML-based applications with business needs while accounting for their structural limitations. Beyond the MLbC context, this study offers a strategic framework that can be adapted for different cases of digital transformation that include automation and augmentation of work.

AB  - With ongoing technological advances, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly capable of handling not only repetitive tasks, but also so called "white collar" knowledge work involving abstract cognition and communication to accomplish complex tasks. However, AI's limitations regarding adapting and processing exception events, finding creative solutions, and making ethical and moral evaluations render the involvement of human users as AI overseers or ultimate decision-makers necessary. The effectiveness of such a human-in-the-loop approach will depend on a multitude of factors, including those related to user interactions afforded by the design of the AI. This paper reports the current state of a work-in-progress research project aiming to identify key design considerations and their implications to keep humans in the loop when AI handles a complex, knowledge-intensive task. Out of an initial pool of 3,698 peer-reviewed articles, 720 were screened-in for relevance. From a subset of 18 articles used in this paper, preliminary findings, implications for theory and practice, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Optimizing the cooling system plays a central role for capping the data center power consumption. However, the performance of traditional cooling management strategies is not satisfactory due to the complexity of thermodynamic process. Recently, several works leveraged Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve the energy efficiency of data center cooling system. While they demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the cooling power consumption via RL, there are still some key challenges that have to be addressed before field deployment, such as safe operation guarantee and sample complexity, etc. In this paper, we propose SafeCool, an actor-critic Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) algorithm for data center cooling management. SafeCool incorporates two system models, i.e., a transition model to predict the future system state and a risk model to estimate the negative effect of executing an action. The safety of proposed algorithm is ensured by Model Predictive Control (MPC) and risk-guided exploration. In addition, by employing the MBRL framework, SafeCool achieves higher sample efficiency and accelerated convergence. Simulations using real-world workload trace reveal that SafeCool saves up to 13.18% cooling power compared with state-of-the-art MBRL data center cooling solutions.

T2  - ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - In voicing commitments to the principle that the adoption of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools by armed forces should be done responsibly, a growing number of states have referred to a concept of "Responsible AI." As part of an effort to help develop the substantive contours of that concept in meaningful ways, this position paper introduces a notion of "responsible reliance." It is submitted that this notion could help the policy conversation expand from its current relatively narrow focus on interactions between an AI system and its end-user to also encompass the wider set of interdependencies involved in fulfilling legal obligations concerning the use of AI in armed conflicts. The authors argue that to respect international humanitarian law and ensure accountability, states ought to devise and maintain a framework that ensures that natural persons involved in the use an AI tool in an armed conflict could responsibly rely at least on: (1) the tool's technical aspects, (2) the conduct of other people involved in development and use of that AI tool; and (3) the policies and processes implemented at the state level. According to the authors, the "responsible reliance" notion could serve, among other examples, as a basis on which to articulate legal requirements, prohibitions, and permissions across diverse areas, from the design of AI tools to human-machine interactions to configuration of responsible-command frameworks.

AB  - AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we perform an empirical study involving interviews with 21 scientists and engineers to understand the practitioners' views on AI ethics principles and their implementation. Our major findings are: (1) the current practice is often a done-once-and-forget type of ethical risk assessment at a particular development step, which is not sufficient for highly uncertain and continual learning AI systems; (2) ethical requirements are either omitted or mostly stated as high-level objectives, and not specified explicitly in verifiable way as system outputs or outcomes; (3) although ethical requirements have the characteristics of cross-cutting quality and non-functional requirements amenable to architecture and design analysis, system-level architecture and design are under-explored; (4) there is a strong desire for continuously monitoring and validating AI systems post deployment for ethical requirements but current operation practices provide limited guidance. To address these findings, we suggest a preliminary list of patterns to provide operationalised guidance for developing responsible AI systems.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - Integral Reinforcement learning (IRL) can optimize control systems through a stable training process without analytical models. However, when online machine learning is applied to industry, the safety constraints of physical processes cannot be violated. To address the safety problem, this paper proposes a safe online IRL scheme for control systems under the control output saturation via controller decomposition. The proposed scheme decomposes a controller into several sub-controllers in which the saturation range is divided into small portions to constrain the learning error of individual sub-controllers, thereby confining the system state within the safety region. To reduce conservatism, a training procedure is proposed for the scheme, which trains the sub-controllers one by one in a loop until all of them are optimal. Theoretical analysis results indicate the proposed scheme can ensure safety under the suggested division of the controller without any performance degradation. The simulation of two cases verifies the safety of the proposed scheme under random initial parameters for learning. Additionally, the proposed scheme is compared with several existing safe reinforcement learning methods, and the results illustrate the advantages of the proposed scheme in ensuring the safety and mitigating the fluctuation of state curves during learning.

TI  - Provably Safe Artificial General Intelligence via Interactive Proofs
AU  - Carlson, K
T2  - PHILOSOPHIES
AB  - Methods are currently lacking to prove artificial general intelligence (AGI) safety. An AGI 'hard takeoff' is possible, in which first generation AGI(1) rapidly triggers a succession of more powerful AGI(n) that differ dramatically in their computational capabilities (AGI(n) << AGI(n+1)). No proof exists that AGI will benefit humans or of a sound value-alignment method. Numerous paths toward human extinction or subjugation have been identified. We suggest that probabilistic proof methods are the fundamental paradigm for proving safety and value-alignment between disparately powerful autonomous agents. Interactive proof systems (IPS) describe mathematical communication protocols wherein a Verifier queries a computationally more powerful Prover and reduces the probability of the Prover deceiving the Verifier to any specified low probability (e.g., 2(-100)). IPS procedures can test AGI behavior control systems that incorporate hard-coded ethics or value-learning methods. Mapping the axioms and transformation rules of a behavior control system to a finite set of prime numbers allows validation of 'safe' behavior via IPS number-theoretic methods. Many other representations are needed for proving various AGI properties. Multi-prover IPS, program-checking IPS, and probabilistically checkable proofs further extend the paradigm. In toto, IPS provides a way to reduce AGI(n) <-> AGI(n+1) interaction hazards to an acceptably low level.

AB  - We present the Neural Simplex Architecture (NSA), a new approach to runtime assurance that provides safety guarantees for neural controllers (obtained e.g. using reinforcement learning) of autonomous and other complex systems without unduly sacrificing performance. NSA is inspired by the Simplex control architecture of Sha et al., but with some significant differences. In the traditional approach, the advanced controller (AC) is treated as a black box; when the decision module switches control to the baseline controller (BC), the BC remains in control forever. There is relatively little work on switching control back to the AC, and there are no techniques for correcting the AC's behavior after it generates a potentially unsafe control input that causes a failover to the BC. Our NSA addresses both of these limitations. NSA not only provides safety assurances in the presence of a possibly unsafe neural controller, but can also improve the safety of such a controller in an online setting via retraining, without overly degrading its performance. To demonstrate NSA's benefits, we have conducted several significant case studies in the continuous control domain. These include a target-seeking ground rover navigating an obstacle field, and a neural controller for an artificial pancreas system.

AB  - Process and energy industries have been recognised as adopters of high levels of automation compared to other sectors. Nonetheless, human cognitive input still plays a critical role in the operation of process plants and replication of these cognitive capabilities remains a key challenge for advancing automation levels. In this paper, we provide an analysis of process and energy industries based on a scenario of reduced availability of skilled labour and increased demands for safety, sustainability, and resilience. We consider the different mechanical, sensing, situational awareness, and decision-making tasks involved in the operation of plants and map them to possible realisations of unmanned and autonomous systems. We discuss the implications of current technology capabilities and future technology development perspectives, the factors influencing the complexity of operation in process plants, and the importance of human-machine collaboration. As part of autonomous system capabilities, we consider adaptation as a key capability and we make a connection to adaptation of model-based solutions. We argue that reaching higher and wider levels of autonomy requires a rethink of the design processes for both the physical plants as well as the way automation, control, and safety solutions are conceptualised.

AB  - Data gathering and information processing have evolved to where it is almost unfathomable how much exists in digital form today. The generation thereof also no longer involves an explicit instruction from human to machine but can happen in real-time without human intervention. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive computing are being utilized to mine data from a variety of sources. One such (profitable) source is human beings. Digital algorithms are designed to harness the power of technology to gather information. There has always been a sense of secrecy regarding some information (classified, top secret, confidential, etc.) but the Fourth Industrial Revolution has created the means to gather extremely large amounts of data, unknown to its sources. Anthropological value systems should become a fundamental foundation of digital algorithms. Such an approach could prevent software from exploiting its sources, especially minorities. Value systems together with ethics are guided by people's culture. In ethically aligned algorithm design, value systems and digital technologies intersect and govern how algorithms are developed, the way data is engaged, and further the discipline of digital humanities.

TI  - Intelligent Energy-Efficient Train Trajectory Optimization Approach Based on Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Urban Rail Transits
AU  - Li, GN

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)-enabled intelligent automatic train operation (iATO) is an urgently needed technology to expand the capability of ATO in addressing the real-time responsiveness and dynamic online challenges to energy-efficient train trajectory optimization (TTO) and its associated ride-comfort, punctuality, and safety issues in modern urban rail transit networks. This paper proposes a three-step supervised reinforcement learning-based intelligent energy-efficient train trajectory optimization (SRL-IETTO) approach for iATO by hybrid-integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and supervised learning. First, multiple objectives are formulated based on real-time train operation and systematically integrated into the RL algorithm by a binary function-based goal-directed reward design method. Second, an IETTO model is established to handle uncertain disturbances in real-time train operation and generate optimal energy-efficient train trajectories online by optimizing energy efficiency and receiving supervisory information from trajectories of pre-trained TTO models. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the SRL-IETTO using in-service subway line data. The results demonstrate the superiority and improved energy saving of the proposed approach and confirm its adaptability to online trip time adjustments within the practical running time range under uncertain disturbances with less trip time error compared to other intelligent TTO algorithms.

T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The drilling process is complex because unexpected situations may occur at any time. Furthermore, the drilling system is extremely long and slender, therefore prone to vibrations and often being dominated by long transient periods. Adding the fact that measurements are not well distributed along the drilling system, with the majority of real-time measurements only available at the top side and having only access to very sparse data from downhole, the drilling process is poorly observed therefore making it difficult to use standard control methods. Therefore, to achieve completely autonomous drilling operations, it is necessary to utilize a method that is capable of estimating the internal state of the drilling system from parsimonious information while being able to make decisions that will keep the operation safe but effective. A solution enabling autonomous decision-making while drilling has been developed. It relies on an optimization of the time to reach the section total depth (TD). The estimated time to reach the section TD is decomposed into the effective time spent in conducting the drilling operation and the likely time lost to solve unexpected drilling events. This optimization problem is solved by using a Markov decision process method. Several example scenarios have been run in a virtual rig environment to test the validity of the concept. It is found that the system is capable to adapt itself to various drilling conditions, as for example being aggressive when the operation runs smoothly and the estimated uncertainty of the internal states is low, but also more cautious when the downhole drilling conditions deteriorate or when observations tend to indicate more erratic behavior, which is often observed prior to a drilling event.

AB  - Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are important for maintaining the system performance and guaranteeing the operational safety. The traditional data-driven approaches mostly incorporate well-defined features and methodologies such as supervised artificial intelligence algorithms. Prior knowledge of possible features and a large quantity of labelled condition data are needed. Besides, many traditional approaches require rebuilding or a retraining of the original model to diagnosis new conditions. The present study proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis approach that uses a deep neural network (DNN) based on stacked denoising autoencoder. Representative features are learned by applying the denoising autoencoder to the unlabelled data in an unsupervised manner. A DNN is then constructed and fine-tuned with just a few items of labelled data. The trained DNN achieves high performance in fault classification. Furthermore, new conditions can be correctly classified by simply fine-tuning the trained DNN model using a small amount of labelled data under the new conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using a case study of fault diagnosis of a bearing unit. The results indicate that the proposed method can extract representative features from massive unlabelled data on the system condition and achieve high performance in fault diagnosis.

AB  - Hazardous waste remediation often requires the application of new technologies. In recent years, these technologies have undergone rapid development. Intensely scrutinized in terms of design, new technologies surprisingly receive little attention when assessing the hazards they might pose to worker health and safety.(8) A readily available and user friendly safety and health assessment tool for design evaluation can help assure the safety for operators and the public.(1) This concept involves obtaining data for defining a technology, identifying and defining the elements and the hazards associated with these technology elements in terms of sources and types, evaluating the process to identify potential for human errors, building queries to suggest for removing or controlling the hazards, evaluating the interaction of technology elements, and finally, providing a summary of the hazards identified and suggested corrective measures.(2) Thus far, the system was prototyped to a small existing technology of very limited scope. It showed that design-for-safety can indeed be possible using computer systems that are linked to the Internet. The system was researched for its robustness, design integrity, and the advantage of using expert systems for "What-If" scenarios.

AB  - New technologies that are used on remediation sites rarely undergo testing for safety and health-related impacts on the workforce and the community. A user friendly safety and health assessment tool for design evaluation can help assure the safety for operators and the public. The system involves identifying a number of technology elements, the hazards associated with them, potential human injuries associated with the technologies, and the way they were designed. The system suggests recommendations for controlling the hazards and evaluates the interaction of technology elements. During the first year, the system was prototyped to a small existing technology of very limited scope. It showed that design for safety can indeed be possible using computer-systems. The focus of the second year has been to expand the system to accommodate 10 commonly used pieces of technologies. The system was developed to be a work-in-process design aid.

TI  - Hybrid reality development-can social responsibility concepts provide guidance?
AU  - Perko, I
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to define hybrid reality (HyR) as an ongoing process in which artificial intelligence (AI) technology is gradually introduced as an active stakeholder by using reasoning to execute real-life activities. Also, to examine the implications of social responsibility (SR) concepts as featured in the HyR underlying common framework to progress towards the redefinition of global society. Design/methodology/approach A combination of systemic tools is used to examine and assess the development of HyR. The research is based on evolutionary and learning concepts, leading to the new meta-system development. It also builds upon the viable system model and AI, invoking SR as a conceptual framework. The research is conducted by using a new approach: using system dynamics based interactions modelling, the following two models have been proposed. The state-of-the-art HyR interactions model, examined using SR concepts; and a SR concept-based HyR model, examined using a smart vehicle case. Findings In the HyR model, interaction asymmetry between stakeholders is identified, possibly leading to pathological behaviour and AI technology learning corruption. To resolve these asymmetry issues, an interaction model based on SR concepts is proposed and examined on the example of an autonomous vehicle transport service. The examination results display significant changes in the conceptual understanding of transport services, their utilisation and data-sharing concepts. Research limitations/implications As the research proposal is theoretical in nature, the projection may not display a fully holistic perspective and can/should be complemented with empirical research results. Practical implications For researchers, HyR provides a new paradigm and can thereby articulate potential research frameworks. HyR designers can recognise projected development paths and the resources required for the implication of SR concepts. Individuals and organisations should be aware of their not necessarily passive role in HyR and can therefore use the necessary social force to activate their status. Originality/value For the first time, to the best of the author's knowledge, the term HyR is openly elaborated and systemically examined by invoking concepts of SR. The proposed model provides an overview of the current and potential states of HyR and examines the gap between them.

AB  - In an era characterized by the widespread use of algorithmic systems and platforms in news production and distribution practices, the ethical practices of journalists face significant challenges. Drawing on Floridi's onlife framework, this study aims to shed light on journalist-machine interactions and explores new ways to rearchitect journalism ethical standards through an integrative, object-oriented approach. In-depth interviews with local news workers throughout the U.S. reveal a range of issues related to decontextualization in algorithmic platform design, the hidden price of platform partnerships, and the growing reliance on automated tools that foreshadow ethical issues to come. These algorithmically-induced challenges appear to be particularly pronounced in local newsrooms, highlighting the disproportionate impact of algorithmic systems on under-served media sectors. Discussions are made around the constant push-and-pull over editorial power dynamics apparent in local news workers' use of algorithmic systems. A distributed responsibility model is proposed as a practical way to hold multiple actors, including both humans and algorithms, accountable for journalism's ethical standards in the algorithmic era.

AB  - Objective: To characterise the use of an electronic medication safety dashboard by exploring and contrasting interactions from primary users (i.e. pharmacists) who were leading the intervention and secondary users (i.e. non-pharmacist staff) who used the dashboard to engage in safe prescribing practices.
Materials and methods: We conducted a 10-month observational study in which 35 health professionals used an instrumented medication safety dashboard for audit and feedback purposes in clinical practice as part of a wider intervention study. We modelled user interaction by computing features representing exploration and dwell time through user interface events that were logged on a remote database. We applied supervised learning algorithms to classify primary against secondary users.
Results: We observed values for accuracy above 0.8, indicating that 80% of the time we were able to distinguish a primary user from a secondary user. In particular, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) yielded the highest values of precision (0.88), recall (0.86) and F-measure (0.86). The behaviour of primary users was distinctive in that they spent less time between mouse clicks (lower dwell time) on the screens showing the overview of the practice and trends. Secondary users exhibited a higher dwell time and more visual search activity (higher exploration) on the screens displaying patients at risk and visualisations.
Discussion and conclusion: We were able to distinguish the interactive behaviour of primary and secondary users of a medication safety dashboard in primary care using timestamped mouse events. Primary users were more competent on population health monitoring activities, while secondary users struggled on activities involving a detailed breakdown of the safety of patients. Informed by these findings, we propose workflows that group these activities and adaptive nudges to increase user engagement.

TI  - A Framework for Hierarchical Perception-Action Learning Utilizing Fuzzy Reasoning
AU  - Windridge, D
AU  - Felsberg, M
AU  - Shaukat, A
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
AB  - Perception-action (P-A) learning is an approach to cognitive system building that seeks to reduce the complexity associated with conventional environment-representation/action-planning approaches. Instead, actions are directly mapped onto the perceptual transitions that they bring about, eliminating the need for intermediate representation and significantly reducing training requirements. We here set out a very general learning framework for cognitive systems in which online learning of the P-Amapping may be conducted within a symbolic processing context, so that complex contextual reasoning can influence the P-A mapping. In utilizing a variational calculus approach to define a suitable objective function, the P-A mapping can be treated as an online learning problem via gradient descent using partial derivatives. Our central theoretical result is to demonstrate top-down modulation of low-level perceptual confidences via the Jacobian of the higher levels of a subsumptive P-A hierarchy. Thus, the separation of the Jacobian as a multiplying factor between levels within the objective function naturally enables the integration of abstract symbolic manipulation in the form of fuzzy deductive logic into the P-A mapping learning. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting framework achieves significantly better accuracy than using P-A learning without top-down modulation. We also demonstrate that it permits novel forms of context-dependent multilevel P-A mapping, applying the mechanism in the context of an intelligent driver assistance system.

AB  - The 2015 CS-CASH (Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health, 2015) Injury Surveillance Surveys showed that around 19% of injuries to agricul-tural producers are related to tractors or large agricultural machinery, yet only a limited number of studies are found that address tools and methods for monitoring safety behav-iors of agricultural machinery operators in real-time. The current safety behavior moni-toring approaches require an in-person presence, which can be both time-and cost-ineffi-cient, and the other available methods lack a feedback element to alert operators in real -time. As a result, the research presented in this study aimed to develop an automated ap-proach to monitoring tractor operators' safety behaviors through the use of a trained ma-chine learning (ML) model and a feedback system to alert operators when they engage in unsafe practices. For the ML model development, a skeleton-detecting algorithm called OpenPose was used to detect real-time human postures in a livestreaming video feed from a camera installed in the tractor cab. The model was then trained on three separate cate-gories of tractor operators' safety operating behaviors, and this trained classifier was used to label operators' safety behaviors in real time based on the three safety classes. A feed-back mechanism controlled by an onboard microcontroller was then used to alert the op-erators when unsafe operating behavior was detected to facilitate safe practices. This mon-itoring system, named Ag-OMS (Agricultural Machinery Operators Monitoring System), monitored the ingress/egress operators' behaviors in real-time entering and exiting the tractor cab. The Ag-OMS successfully identified the ingress/egress operators' behaviors with an accuracy of 97% on the testing datasets for all safety risk categories.

TI  - Modeling Trust in COVID-19 Contact-Tracing Apps Using the Human-Computer Trust Scale: Online Survey Study
AU  - Sousa, S
AU  - Kalju, T
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in technology use worldwide, both socially and economically. This pandemic crisis has brought additional measures such as contact-tracing apps (CTAs) to help fight against spread of the virus. Unfortunately, the low adoption rate of these apps affected their success. There could be many reasons for the low adoption, including concerns of security and privacy, along with reported issues of trust in CTAs. Some concerns are related with how CTAs could be used as surveillance tools or their potential threats to privacy as they involve health data. For example, in Estonia, the CTA named HOIA had approximately 250,000 downloads in the middle of January 2021. However, in 2021, only 4.7% of the population used HOIA as a COVID-19 CTA. The reasons for the low adoption include lack of competency, and privacy and security concerns. This lower adoption and the lack of trustworthiness persist despite efforts of the European Union in building ethics and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI)-based apps.
Objective: The aim of this study was to understand how to measure trust in health technologies. Specifically, we assessed the usefulness of the Human-Computer Trust Scale (HCTS) to measure Estonians' trust in the HOIA app and the causes for this lack of trust.
Methods: The main research question was: Can the HCTS be used to assess citizens' perception of trust in health technologies? We established four hypotheses that were tested with a survey. We used a convenience sample for data collection, including sharing the questionnaire on social network sites and using the snowball method to reach all potential HOIA users in the Estonian population.
Results: Among the 78 respondents, 61 had downloaded the HOIA app with data on usage patterns. However, 20 of those who downloaded the app admitted that it was never opened despite most claiming to regularly use mobile apps. The main reasons included not understanding how it works, and privacy and security concerns. Significant correlations were found between participants' trust in CTAs in general and their perceived trust in the HOIA app regarding three attributes: competency (P<.001), risk perception (P<.001), and reciprocity (P=.01).
Conclusions: This study shows that trust in the HOIA app among Estonian residents did affect their predisposition to use the app. Participants did not generally believe that HOIA could help to control the spread of the virus. The result of this work is limited to HOIA and health apps that use similar contact-tracing methods. However, the findings can contribute to gaining a broader understanding and awareness of the need for designing trustworthy technologies. Moreover, this work can help to provide design recommendations that ensure trustworthiness in CTAs, and the ability of AI to use highly sensitive data and serve society.

AB  - We developed a machine learning based surrogate model to identify sustainability pathways through rapid scenario generation and defined the safe operating space for achieving them via scenario discovery. We trained a surrogate model to replicate the Land-Use Trade-Offs integrated model of the Australian land system. Latin hypercube sampling was used to create many scenarios exploring the impact of uncertainties in key drivers including future socio-economic development, climate change mitigation, and agricultural productivity at a granular level. Economic and environmental impacts were evaluated against nationally downscaled SDG targets. Scenario discovery revealed new pathways to achieving five SDG targets for 2050 which required crop yield increases above 1.78 times, a carbon price above 100 AU$ tCO(2)(-1), a > 9% biodiversity levy on carbon plantings, and carefully regulated land-use policy. Machine learning based surrogate modeling teamed with scenario discovery revealed the policy and scenario settings required for a more sustainable future for the Australian land sector.Plain Language Summary Sustainable pathways are elusive in land systems due to their complexity, trade-offs, and uncertainties. We used a machine learning-based surrogate modeling approach to explore future uncertainties through rapid scenario generation and identify policy settings defining the safe operating space for future land sector sustainability.

AB  - The feedback alignment provides a biologically plausible learning mechanism, which can directly transmit error signals with a random weight matrix to multiple layers of a neural network. This paper proposes an online supervised learning algorithm based on the feedback alignment mechanism for multilayer spiking neural networks, named Multi-OSLFA, which can support real-time learning for the spatio-temporal pattern of spike trains. The online learning rule is represented by the kernel function of spike trains and adjusts the synaptic weights when the output neuron fires a spike during the miming process of spiking neural networks. The Multi-OSLFA algorithm is successfully applied to spike train learning tasks and nonlinear pattern classification problems on two UCI datasets. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve learning accuracy in comparison with other supervised learning algorithms. It shows that the proposed learning algorithm is effective for solving spatio-temporal pattern learning problems.

T2  - IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION
AB  - One of the most important challenges in microgrid operation is the unintentional islanding occurrence. Unintentional islanding can cause serious safety hazards and technical issues. Islanding detection methods can be classified into active and passive methods. The main disadvantages of the passive methods are large non-detection zone as well as determination of suitable threshold value to avoid unwanted distributed generations tripping in normal network events. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this study proposes a novel, fast, and reliable method to identify islanding conditions. The proposed method calculates different transient states in the rate of change of frequency signal in two consecutive cycles. Various features of the differential signal are extracted. The extracted feature vectors associated with different operation conditions such as islanding and non-islanding events are used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs). The performances of different structures of ANNs and also other machine learning methods such as support vector machine and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system are evaluated for islanding detection purposes. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides more accurate and faster responses compared with other conventional islanding detection methods.

AB  - Remediation of hazardous waste may require the application of new technologies. These technologies are usuary designed by experts who know very Little about safety and health issues. A user-friendly, easily accessible system that is devised to assist designers during the design phase by pointing out the different downfalls of their design with respect to safety and health issues and impacts, can dramatically improve hazardous waste remediation safety, reduce costs, and most importantly, reduce the chances of injuries and fatalities associated with such technologies. For easy accessability, the system should be online via the internet. Hence, this web-based consultant was designed using a knowledge-based expert system. The system was initially designed by implementing a simple machine, a ditch-digger. All hazardous events related to using a ditch-digger were documented into the rules of the ES. Ultimately, the final version of this system will allow designers to enter and analyze their designs in terms of safety and health. Recommendations will be provided to reduce the potential for hazard exposure. This tool should dramatically enhance the safety of new technologies at a fraction of the currently incurred costs.

TI  - The Responsibility Quantification Model of Human Interaction With Automation
AU  - Douer, N
AU  - Meyer, J
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - Intelligent systems and advanced automation are involved in information collection and evaluation, decision-making, and the implementation of chosen actions. In such systems, human responsibility becomes equivocal. Understanding human causal responsibility is particularly important when systems can harm people, as with autonomous vehicles or, most notably, with autonomous weapon systems (AWSs). Using information theory, we developed a responsibility quantification (ResQu) model of human causal responsibility in intelligent systems and demonstrated its applications on decisions regarding AWS. The analysis reveals that comparative human responsibility for outcomes is often low, even when major functions are allocated to the human. Thus, broadly stated policies of keeping humans in the loop and having meaningful human control are misleading and cannot truly direct decisions on how to involve humans in advanced automation. The current model assumes stationarity, full knowledge regarding the characteristic of the human and automation, and ignores temporal aspects. It is an initial step toward the development of a comprehensive responsibility model that will make it possible to quantify human causal responsibility. The model can serve as an additional tool in the analysis of system design alternatives and policy decisions regarding human causal responsibility, providing a novel, quantitative perspective on these matters. Note to Practitioners-We developed a theoretical model and a quantitative measure for computing the comparative human causal responsibility in the interaction with intelligent systems and advanced automation. Our responsibility measure can be applied by practitioners (system designers, regulators, and so on) to estimate user responsibility in specific system configurations. This can serve as an additional tool in the comparison between alternative system designs or deployment policies, by relating different automation design options to their predicted effect on the users' responsibility. To apply the model (which is based on entropy and mutual information) to real-world systems, one must deduce the underlying distributions, either from known system properties or from empirical observations, taken over time. The initial version of the model we present here assumes that the combined human-automation system is stationary and ergodic. Real-world systems may not be stationary and ergodic or cannot be observed sufficiently to allow accurate estimates of the required input of multivariate probabilities, in which case the computed responsibility values should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the construction of a ResQu information flow model, combined with sensitivity analyses of how changes in the input probabilities and assumptions affect the responsibility measure, will often reveal important qualitative properties and supply valuable insights regarding the general level of meaningful human involvement and comparative responsibility in a system.

AU  - Li, HL

T2  - LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES
AB  - The dynamic responses of the high-speed railway bridge under the train passage can greatly affect the safety of the entire high-speed train and bridge system. Traditionally, these responses are obtained using either field measurement or numerical analysis. Both tools have their own limitations. For instance, the coupling dynamic train-bridge analysis is generally complicated and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel machine learning based approach for efficient safety evaluation of the high speed train and short span bridge system. Artificial neural networks are established to map the complicated train-bridge system and to attain the critical bridge displacements. The proposed approach incorporates a complete numerical train-bridge system model to produce reliable data for the neural network training, considering multiple significant random features in the train-bridge system. Various neural network architectures are investigated and compared to find optimal ones that have considerable potentials in realizing online response prediction and safety evaluation. Although the proposed approach focuses on the high-speed train and short span bridge, the methodology is general and can also be applied to other scenarios associated with the vehicle-bridge systems.

AB  - Vehicle safety is one of the most important research topics not only for vehicular industry but also for auto insurance companies. It is of great significance for them to avoid compensating damaged vehicles and dealing with an incredible number of correct and fraudulent claims. In fact, fraudulent claims present a huge and a costly problem for insurance companies and end up with big losses reaching over billions of Dollars yearly. These frauds also have social-economical consequences as their costs are defrayed by the policy holder through the increase of their premiums to cover the insurer loss. Several insurance companies are exploring innovative solutions not only to improve customers safety and driving experience but also to streamline fraud detection methods since traditional ones are complex, time-consuming, and usually lead to inaccurate results. In this paper, we develop an automated fraud detection approach for auto insurance companies based on extreme gradient boosting algorithm, aka XGBoost. The objective is to automatically detect fraudulent claims and classify them into different fraud types. To this end, data analysis techniques are used to clean, explore, and extract relevant features. The proposed framework aims to minimize human intervention, deliver alerts for risky claims, and reduce monetary losses in the auto insurance industry. The obtained results reveal a high performance gain achieved by XGBoost in detecting and classifying fraudulent claims compared to other machine learning algorithms.

AB  - One of the most challenging puzzles in drug discovery is the identification and characterization of candidate drug of well-balanced profile between efficacy and safety. So far, extensive efforts have been made to evaluate this balance by estimating the quantitative structure-therapeutic relationship and exploring target profile of adverse drug reaction. Particularly, the therapeutic index (TI) has emerged as a key indicator illustrating this delicate balance, and a clinically successful agent requires a sufficient TI suitable for it corresponding indication. However, the TI information are largely unknown for most drugs, and the mechanism underlying the drugs with narrow TI (NTI drugs) is still elusive. In this study, the collective effects of human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and biological system profile on the drugs' efficacy-safety balance were systematically evaluated. First, a comprehensive literature review of the FDA approved drugs confirmed their NTI status. Second, a popular feature selection algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI) was adopted to identify key factors differencing the target mechanism between NTI and non-NTI drugs. Finally, this work revealed that the targets of NTI drugs were highly centralized and connected in human PPI network, and the number of similarity proteins and affiliated signaling pathways of the corresponding targets was much higher than those of non-NTI drugs. These findings together with the newly discovered features or feature groups clarified the key factors indicating drug's narrow TI, and could thus provide a novel direction for determining the delicate drug efficacy-safety balance.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB  - Driving requires the ability to handle unpredictable situations. Since it is not always possible to predict an impending danger, a good driver should preventively assess whether a situation has risks and adopt a safe behavior. Considering, in particular, the possibility of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, a prudent driver should limit the traveling speed. We present a work exploiting reinforcement learning to learn a function that specifies the safe speed limit for a given artificial driver agent. The safe speed function acts as a behavioral directive for the agent, thus extending its cognitive abilities. We consider scenarios where the vehicle interacts with a distracted pedestrian that might cross the road in hard-to-predict ways and propose a neural network mapping the pedestrian's context onto the appropriate traveling speed so that the autonomous vehicle can successfully perform emergency braking maneuvers. We discuss the advantages of developing a specialized neural network extension on top of an already functioning autonomous driving system, removing the burden of learning to drive from scratch while focusing on learning safe behavior at a highlevel. We demonstrate how the safe speed function can be learned in simulation and then transferred into a real vehicle. We include a statistical analysis of the network's improvements compared to the original autonomous driving system. The code implementing the presented network is available at https://githuh.com/tonegas/safe-speed-neural-network with MIT license and at https://zenodo.org/communities/dreams4cars.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY
AB  - As an important part of traffic safety analysis, crash prediction models using road geometric alignments and traffic data (CPM-GAs) have been regarded as the most classic way and can be used in stages of road safety evaluation and road operating and management. To improve the predictive performance of tradition CPM-GAs and avoid the overfitting problem of machine learning algorithms, a framework of CPM-GA based on ensemble learning theory and a new ensemble rule for connecting traditional models and machine learning models were proposed in this study. Results of the ensemble learning CPM-GA show that (1) classification and regression tree (CART) is recommended for important variable selection procedure before applying support vector machine (SVM), (2) machine learning models outperformed traditional models significantly in aspects of model fitting and prediction accuracy but are unstable in the sensitivity tests, (3) the new proposed ensemble method of traditional model and machine learning model can effectively improve the accuracy of traditional CPM-GAs by 10%-16% and reduce the variance of machine learning CPM-GAs by 12%-36% simultaneously. Finally, the ensemble method presented in this article may shed light on more research of crash prediction models based on ensemble learning theory.

AB  - The article material reflects the trend development implementing into the shipping industry practice the vessels without a crew on board. Equipping modern ships with integrated monitoring and control systems allows the ship's power plant to be operated without the constant presence of the engine crew members. Many issues related to the maintenance of mechanisms and devices are resolved during inter-trip stops by special personnel. This brings the crew activities closer to the working conditions of the technological facilities operators and stimulates the appearance of means of transport with a small crew or no crew at all. Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS), as they are classified in international practice, are already a reality and it is necessary to reasonably approach the control system as the number of such objects increases and their technical improvement. The main attention in the article is paid to the role and location of ship specialists, without whom it is practically impossible to operate a ship power plant in technically competent manner, regardless of its type and design features. Examples of already operating MASS are given. The authors consider the most realistic options for an artificial intelligence system formation and endowing it with the functions of monitoring the state and control of the elements of ship power engineering.

AB  - Cohesive subgraph mining on attributed social networks is attracting much attention in the realm of graph mining and analysis. Most existing studies on cohesive subgraph mining over attributed social networks neglect the fairness of attributes, which lead to difficulties in deploying responsible applications. Toward this end, this article formulates a new problem by introducing fairness into cliques model to mine the absolute fair cliques from attributed social networks. Specifically, this article adopts formal concept analysis (FCA) methodology to represent the given attributed social network, and extracts a set of special attributed equiconcepts to further return the absolute fair maximal cliques. Then, we develop an efficient absolute fair cliques detection algorithm AFCMiner for the cases of single-dimensional attributed social networks, multivalued attributed social networks, as well as multidimensional attributed social networks. Extensive experiments are conducted for demonstrating that the proposed AFCMiner algorithm can significantly reduce the time for finding absolute fair cliques with the correctness guarantee. Finally, a case study is also presented for uncovering the usefulness of our model.

AB  - Considering both the tracking safety of multi-HSTs and the operational efficiency of a single HST, intelligent safe driving methods (ISDMs) are proposed to obtain better speed-distance curves by integrating hybrid automata (HA) with data mining algorithms in this paper. To begin with, an intelligent safe distance controller is established by using HA to ensure the tracking safety of multi-HSTs' operation in real time. Then, data-driven intelligent driving methods based on ensemble algorithms (Bagging or Adaboost.R) and classification and regression tree (CART) are proposed to discover the potential driving rules from the field driving data. Furthermore, because of the continuous rise of HST's operation mileage, the driving data collected from HST has increased tremendously compared with the subways. So, an iterative pruning error minimization algorithm is designed to reduce the redundancy of the driving data and improve the computational speed of the learning process. Finally, compared with the automatic train operation (ATO) method, the energy consumption of B-CART, A-CART, and S-A-CART algorithms can be decreased by 3.32%, 3.80%, and 4.30%, respectively.

While various organizational factors may contribute to such errors, limited studies have addressed patient and staff safety issues simultaneously in the same study setting. To evaluate this, we conduct an exploratory analysis using two types of tree-based machine learning algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting, and the hospital-level aggregate staff experience survey data from UK hospitals. Based on staff views and priorities, the results from both algorithms suggest that "health and wellbeing" is the leading theme associated with the number of reported errors and near misses harming patient and staff safety. Specifically, "work-related stress" is the most important survey item associated with safety outcomes. With respect to prediction accuracy, both algorithms provide similar results with comparable values in error metrics. Based on the analytical results, healthcare risk managers and decision-makers can develop and implement policies and practices that address staff experience and prioritize resources effectively to improve patient and staff safety.

AB  - This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.

AB  - The trustworthiness of robots and autonomous systems (RASs) has taken a prominent position on the way toward full autonomy. This work is the first to systematically explore the key facets of human-centered AI (HAI) for trustworthy RAS (TRAS). We identified five key properties of a TRAS, i.e., RAS must be: 1) safe in any uncertain and dynamic environment; 2) secure, i.e., protect itself from cyber threats; 3) healthy and fault tolerant; 4) trusted and easy to use to enable effective human-machine interaction (HMI); and 5) compliant with the law and ethical expectations. While the applications of RAS have mainly focused on performance and productivity, not enough scientific attention has been paid to the risks posed by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) in RAS. We analytically examine the challenges of implementing TRAS with respect to the five key properties and explore the role and roadmap of AI technologies in ensuring the trustworthiness of RAS in respect of safety, security, health, HMI, and ethics. A new acceptance model of RAS is provided as a framework for HAI requirements and for implementing TRAS by design. This approach promotes human-level intelligence to augment human capabilities and focuses on contribution to humanity.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted various industries, particularly the automotive sector, due to the growing integration of IoT technologies in vehicles. As a result, the volume of data generated by vehicular sensors has increased, leading to a surge in studies focusing on driver behavior to enhance road safety and optimize transportation networks. However, traditional approaches to analyzing driver behavior have relied on supervised offline learning models, which are unsuitable for handling data streams in online learning environments. This study introduces an unsupervised online k-fix AutoCloud algorithm for detecting driver behavior patterns, leveraging the concepts of typicity and eccentricity while considering the historical-temporal relationships between samples. Furthermore, the algorithm autonomously and adaptively evolves without requiring a supervised training phase, making it compatible with the TinyML concept, encompassing Artificial Intelligence algorithms designed for low-power IoT devices. To validate the proposed method, a real case study was conducted over four days using a vehicle to compare the quantity and quality of clusters generated by the algorithm. The findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for optimizing data processing with minimal computational power.

AB  - For a period of 3 weeks in June 2021, we embedded a social robot (Softbank Pepper) in a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school for autistic children. The robot's behaviours and integration into the school were co-designed with the children and teachers, with a focus on improving the well-being of the pupils. Using a mix-method approach, we studied the robot's adoption over the course of the study, and the impact of the robot's presence on the children well-being and the school ecosystem. We found that the robot successfully integrated within the school; it fostered and maintained a steady level of interactions (330 interactions, 16 h of continuous use over 3 weeks) with a small yet meaningful group of children with a positive impact on their well-being; and it led to a nuanced conversation with the students and school staff about the role and impact of such a social technology in a SEN school.

AB  - Maritime traffic flow complexity is the factor that presents in most existing maritime safety analysis methods. It is considered as one of the main influencing factors affecting maritime safety. It can be estimated quantitatively through the analysis of traffic data. To explore maritime ship traffic in more detail, a predictive analytics method utilizing the Lempel-Ziv algorithm and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for traffic safety management is proposed. The Lempel-Ziv algorithm quantifies the entropy for the evaluation of the irregularity and unpredictability of ship travel time sequences, and TOPSIS ranks complexity. The results presented utilize Automatic Identification System (AIS) data corresponding to complex inland waterway traffic scenarios encountered in the Yangtze River. They show that high complexity implies ship travel time sequences are neither periodic nor stochastic, but dependent on the evolution patterns of traffic encounters. A correlation analysis of traffic flow complexity with the number of maritime accidents is carried out, showing that higher traffic flow complexity may result in more unwanted events. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may help to (1) differentiate traffic flow complexity accurately, indicating that the higher the complexity value is, the higher the irregularity and unpredictability of maritime traffic flow are, (2) provide helpful reference for optimizing traffic management over the life cycle of fleet operations as well as maritime safety management of high traffic flow complexity areas.

AB  - Current certification procedures aim at establishing trust in manufacturers of artificial intelligence/machine learning based cyber-physical systems. The certification process usually requires the manufacturer to demonstrate excellence in following safety engineering standards and regulations throughout the holistic system's engineering process. This paper touches on the need for real-world performance monitoring performed by the certifier to ensure that the operational system does not deviate from the specifications. We propose an interactive cooperative process between the manufacturer and certifier which aims at verifying conformance and consistency between the specifications and the operational model while preserving the manufacturer's competitive advantage.

T2  - IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
AB  - Electric shock current identification is essential for the safety in power distribution network. Moreover, as different categories of object have different electric shock current characteristic, a classification model for shock current is essential to be proposed before identification. Therefore, the authors proposed a two-stage framework, including the AdaBoost for the classification and an improved support vector machine (SVM) method for the identification. In the classification stage, the AdaBoost learns the hidden pattern of different electric shock current and generates a predictive model for current classification. Based on the classification results, a fusion method called SVM-NN is proposed in the identification stage, which is based on SVM and neural network (NN) to make fusion determination. The SVM-NN takes advantages of SVM and NN for integration analysis. Based on real data, these classification and identification methods are evaluated. Results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the identification accuracy of electric shock current signal comparing to traditional methods.

AB  - The internet has become an integral part of our lives and it offers new ways to connect to each other. While this has many benefits, it also has a darker side.
Over the recent years, there has been a consistent stream of news articles about children being put at risk due to unsafe online communications. There has been a global drive to educate parents and children around the dangers and provide them with guidelines for safe practice. Yet, reports that another child has gone missing after going to meet someone they had only met online persist.
In this paper, we are presenting our work in designing and developing a prototype system that will provide a safer environment for children online. In order to combat such a complex problem, it is necessary to integrate various artificial intelligent technologies into an autonomous system. The system was implemented using Java Agent Development Environment (JADE), Protege Ontology development and reasoning techniques, and natural language processing (NLP). We have devised a testing system to measure the effectiveness of the system in detecting potential risk to the child. Initial results of experiments are encouraging and demonstrate the system's capability in preventing sensitive information, such as name, address and telephone number being transmitted as part of an on-going conversation. The system will be capable of identifying levels of threat in the context of a longer conversation and recognize the key factors, intention, location and time which contribute to meeting arrangements and proactively generating a warning.

AB  - The need to make sense of complex input data within a vast variety of unpredictable scenarios has been a key driver for the use of machine learning (ML), for example in Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Such systems are usually safety-critical, and therefore they need to be safety assured. In order to consider the results of the safety assurance activities (scoping uncovering previously unknown hazardous scenarios), a continuous approach to arguing safety is required, whilst iteratively improving ML-specific safety-relevant properties, such as robustness and prediction certainty. Such a continuous safety life cycle will only be practical with an efficient and effective approach to analyzing the impact of system changes on the safety case. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated approach for accurately identifying the impact of changes on safety arguments. We focus on arguments that reason about the sufficiency of the data used for the development of ML components. The approach qualitatively and quantitatively analyses the impact of changes in the input space of the considered ML component on other artifacts created during the execution of the safety life cycle, such as datasets and performance requirements and makes recommendations to safety engineers for handling the identified impact. We implement the proposed approach in a model-based safety engineering environment called FASTEN, and we demonstrate its application for an ML-based pedestrian detection component of an ADS.

TI  - Learning to Operate Distribution Networks With Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning
AU  - Li, HP

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB  - In this paper, we propose a safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) based method to solve the problem of optimal operation of distribution networks (OODN). We formulate OODN as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). The objective is to achieve adaptive voltage regulation and energy cost minimization considering the uncertainty of renewable resources (RSs), nodal loads and energy prices. The control actions include the number of in-operation units of the switchable capacitor banks (SCBs), the tap position of the on-load tap-changers (OLTCs) and voltage regulators (VRs), the active and reactive power of distributed generators (DGs), and the charging and discharging power of battery storage systems (BSSs). To optimize the discrete and continuous actions simultaneously, a stochastic policy built upon a joint distribution of mixed random variables is designed and learned through a neural network approximator. To guarantee that safety constraints are satisfied, constrained policy optimization (CPO) is employed to train the neural network. The proposed approach enables the agent to learn a cost-effective operating strategy through exploring safe scheduling actions. Compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods that allow agents to freely explore any behaviors during training, the proposed approach is more practical to be applied in a real system. Simulation results on a modified IEEE-34 node system and a modified IEEE-123 node system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Karachi (Pakistan) has recently been subject to violent incidents targeted primarily at civilians. These incidents are problematic for commuters who use the public bus system and who often fail to reach their work organisations due to consequent bus strikes. This series of events leads to considerable financial losses for the transport industry. This study proposes and implements safe and fast around the road (SAFAR) which is an intelligent transport Android application developed in collaboration with the local transport authority of Karachi. SAFAR provides run-time information to bus commuters regarding recent violent activities farther up from the current location of the commuters on their route. SAFAR employs live Twitter feeds to classify the manner, location, and casualty information of the violence. The authors investigate SAFAR's performance offline with three named entity recognition (NER) approaches, namely, supervised, dictionary-based, and integrated (hybrid), and show that the integrated approach has the best performance with a precision of 85%. Furthermore, SAFAR recommends alternate routes to commuters if violence is detected farther up through the A-star (A*) algorithm. An online evaluation of SAFAR with 50 real users gave a precision of approximate to 85% to identify violence locations. Finally, a subjective evaluation showed that SAFAR's performance is satisfactory.

AB  - Railroad track inspections conducted in accordance with federal regulations and internal railway operating practices result in significant labor costs and occupy valuable network capacity. These factors, combined with advancements in the field of machine vision, have encouraged a transition from human visual inspections to machine-based alternatives. Commercial machine vision technologies for railway inspection currently exist, and automated analysis approaches-which deliver objective results-are available in some systems. However, they are limited to a "pass/fail" approach through the detection of components which fail to meet maintenance or geometry thresholds, as opposed to being able to detect subtle changes in track conditions to identify evolving problems. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents results from the field deployment and validation of a system that pairs three-dimensional (3D) machine vision with automated change detection technology. The change detection approach uses a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to accurately characterize track conditions between repeat runs. Current automated track inspection technologies were studied, and the applicability of change detection is discussed. The paper presents the process for 3D image capture, DCNN training, and evaluation by comparing DCNN results to an expert human evaluator. Finally, it presents change detection results for fastener presence and spike height. Results indicate that this technology can successfully identify fasteners and spikes with percent accuracies greater than 98% and that it can successfully generate change detection results for comparison of track condition among runs.

AB  - A control barrier functions-based quadratic programming (CBF-QP) method has emerged as a controller synthesis tool to assure safety of autonomous systems owing to the appealing safe forward invariant set. However, the provable safety relies on a precisely described dynamic model, which is not always available in practice. Recent works leverage learning to compensate model uncertainty for a CBF controller. However, these approaches based on reinforcement learning or episodic learning are limited to dealing with time-invariant uncertainty. Also, the reinforcement learning approach learns the uncertainty offline, while episodic learning only updates the controller after a batch of data is available by the end of an episode. Instead, we propose a novel tuning extreme learning machine (tELM)-based CBF controller that can compensate time-variant and time-invariant model uncertainty adaptively in an online manner. We validate our approach's effectiveness in a simulation of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system.

T2  - ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence are leading to an increasing human reliance on machine decision making. Even in collaborative efforts with Decision Support Systems (DSSs), where a human expert is expected to make the final decisions, it can be hard to keep the expert actively involved throughout the decision process. DSSs suggest their own solutions and thus invite passive decision making. To keep humans actively 'on' the decision-making loop and counter overreliance on machines, we propose a 'reflection machine' (RM). This system asks users questions about their decision strategy and thereby prompts them to evaluate their own decisions critically. We discuss what forms RMs can take and present a proof-of-concept implementation of a RM that can produce feedback on users' decisions in the medical and law domains. We show that the prototype requires very little domain knowledge to create reasonably intelligent critiquing questions. With this prototype, we demonstrate the technical feasibility to develop RMs and hope to pave the way for future research into their effectiveness and value.

T2  - SAFETY SCIENCE
AB  - Automation is increasing in shipping. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications like collision avoidance and computer vision have the potential to augment or take over the roles of ship navigators. However, implementation of AI technologies may also jeopardize safety if done in a way that reduces human control. In this systematic review, we included 42 studies about human supervision and control of autonomous ships. We addressed three research questions (a) how is human control currently being adopted in autonomous ship sys-tems? (b) what methods, approaches, and theories are being used to address safety concerns and design chal-lenges? and (c) what research gaps, regulatory obstacles, and technical shortcomings represent the most significant barriers to their implementation? We found that (1) human operators have an active role in ensuring autonomous ship safety above and beyond a backup role, (2) System-Theoretic Process Analysis and Bayesian Networks are the most common risk assessment tools in risk-based design, and (3) the new role of shore control center operators will require new competencies and training. The field of autonomous ship research is growing quickly. New risks are emerging from increasing interaction with AI systems in safety-critical systems, under-scoring new research questions. Effective human-AI interaction design is predicated on increased cross- disciplinary efforts, requiring reconciling productivity with safety (resilience), technical limitations with human abilities and expectations (interaction design), and machine task autonomy with human supervisory control (safety management).

TI  - Using a shallow linguistic kernel for drug-drug interaction extraction

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - A drug-drug interaction (DDI) occurs when one drug influences the level or activity of another drug. Information Extraction (IE) techniques can provide health care professionals with an interesting way to reduce time spent reviewing the literature for potential drug-drug interactions. Nevertheless, no approach has been proposed to the problem of extracting DDIs in biomedical texts. In this article, we study whether a machine learning-based method is appropriate for DDI extraction in biomedical texts and whether the results provided are superior to those obtained from our previously proposed pattern-based approach [1]. The method proposed here for DDI extraction is based on a supervised machine learning technique, more specifically, the shallow linguistic kernel proposed in Giuliano et al. (2006)[2]. Since no benchmark corpus was available to evaluate our approach to DDI extraction, we created the first such corpus. DrugDDI, annotated with 3169 DDIs. We performed several experiments varying the configuration parameters of the shallow linguistic kernel. The model that maximizes the F-measure was evaluated on the test data of the DrugDDI corpus, achieving a precision of 51.03%, a recall of 72.82% and an F-measure of 60.01%.
To the best of our knowledge, this work has proposed the first full solution for the automatic extraction of DDIs from biomedical texts. Our study confirms that the shallow linguistic kernel outperforms our previous pattern-based approach. Additionally, it is our hope that the DrugDDI corpus will allow researchers to explore new solutions to the DDI extraction problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - During decades, the automatic train operation (ATO) system has been gradually adopted in many subway systems for its low-cost and intelligence. This article proposes two smart train operation (STO) algorithms by integrating the expert knowledge with reinforcement learning algorithms. Compared with previous works, the proposed algorithms can realize the control of continuous action for the subway system and optimize multiple critical objectives without using an offline speed profile. First, through learning historical data of experienced subway drivers, we extract the expert knowledge rules and build inference methods to guarantee the riding comfort, the punctuality, and the safety of the subway system. Then we develop two algorithms for optimizing the energy efficiency of train operation. One is the STO algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient named (STOD) and the other is the STO algorithm based on normalized advantage function (STON). Finally, we verify the performance of proposed algorithms via some numerical simulations with the real field data from the Yizhuang Line of the Beijing Subway and illustrate that the developed STO algorithm are better than expert manual driving and existing ATO algorithms in terms of energy efficiency. Moreover, STOD and STON can adapt to different trip times and different resistance conditions.

AB  - Safety culture is a multidimensional concept that may be associated with medical errors and patient safety events in healthcare delivery systems. However, limited evidence is available regarding which safety culture dimensions drive overall patient safety. Moreover, the use of advanced statistical analysis has been limited in past studies of safety culture data. To address these issues, we use hospital-level aggregate survey data from U.S. hospitals to analyze the relationship between the defined safety culture dimensions and the patient safety grade. We use a tree-based machine learning algorithm, random forests, to estimate accurate and stable associations. The results of our analysis show that safety perception, management support, and supervisor/manager expectations are the leading drivers of patient safety grade. More specifically, safety problems in the work unit and work climate provided by hospital management are specific drivers of patient safety outcomes. The random forest model sheds new light on the most important cultural features relevant to patient safety.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (D/AI) raise several responsibility challenges. Though many frameworks and tools have been developed, determining what principles should be translated into practice remains under debate. This scoping review aims to provide policymakers with a rigorous body of knowledge by asking: 1) what kinds of practice-oriented tools are available?; 2) on what principles do they predominantly rely?; and 3) what are their limitations?Methods: We searched six academic and three grey literature databases for practice-oriented tools, defined as frameworks and/or sets of principles with clear operational explanations, published in English or French from 2015 to 2021. Characteristics of the tools were qualitatively coded and variations across the dataset identified through descriptive statistics and a network analysis.Findings: A total of 56 tools met our inclusion criteria: 19 health-specific tools (33.9%) and 37 generic tools (66.1%). They adopt a normative (57.1%), reflective (35.7%), operational (3.6%), or mixed approach (3.6%) to guide developers (14.3%), managers (16.1%), end users (10.7%), policymakers (5.4%) or multiple groups (53.6%). The frequency of 40 principles varies greatly across tools (from 0% for 'environmental sustainability' to 83.8% for 'transparency'). While 50% or more of the generic tools promote up to 19 principles, 50% or more of the health-specific tools promote 10 principles, and 50% or more of all tools disregard 21 principles. In contrast to the scattered network of principles proposed by academia, the business sector emphasizes closely connected principles. Few tools rely on a formal methodology (17.9%).Conclusion: Despite a lack of consensus, there is a solid knowledge-basis for policymakers to anchor their role in such a dynamic field. Because several tools lack rigour and ignore key social, economic, and environmental issues, an integrated and methodologically sound approach to responsibility in D/AI solutions is warranted.

TI  - Three-Stage Inverter-Based Peak Shaving and Volt-VAR Control in Active Distribution Networks Using Online Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning
AU  - Nguyen, HT
AU  - Choi, DH
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB  - This paper presents a three-stage inverter-based peak shaving and Volt-VAR control (VVC) framework in active distribution systems using the online safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. The proposed framework aims to reduce the peak load, voltage violations, and real power loss by coordinating three stages with different control timescales. In the first stage, a day-ahead charging/discharging scheduling of energy storage systems (ESSs) with a 30 min resolution is performed via their inverters for peak shaving. In the second stage, the discharging power of ESSs is adjusted through measurements with a 1 min resolution to completely shave peak loads. A model-free DRL algorithm integrated with a safety module is also implemented in the second stage. Using this algorithm, the reactive powers of photovoltaic (PV) systems and ESSs are controlled by the DRL agent to reduce the voltage violation and real power loss, whereas no voltage violation occurs during the online training process. In the third stage, a proportional-integral controller with real-power compensation is integrated into inverters of PV systems and ESSs to rapidly mitigate local voltage violations with a 0.1 s resolution. The high efficiency and safety of the proposed method were validated on the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 123-bus systems.

AB  - Online Social Networks allow users to share experiences with friends and relatives, make announcements, find news and jobs, and more. Several have user bases that number in the hundred of millions and even billions. Very often many users belong to multiple social networks at the same time under possibly different user names. Identifying a user from one social network on another social network gives information about a user's behavior on each platform, which in turn can help companies perform graph mining tasks, such as community detection and link prediction. The process of identifying or aligning users in multiple networks is called network alignment. These similar (or same) users on different networks are called anchor nodes and the edges between them are called anchor links. The network alignment problem aims at finding these anchor links. In this work we propose two supervised algorithms and one unsupervised algorithm using thresholds. All these algorithms use local structural graph features of users and some of them use additional information about the users. We present the performance of our models in various settings using experiments based on Foursquare-Twitter and Facebook-Twitter data [1]. We show that our approaches perform well even when we use the neighborhood of the users only, and the accuracy improves even more given additional information about a user, such as the username and the profile image. We further show that our best approaches perform better at the HR@1 task than unsupervised and semi-supervised factoid embedding approaches considered earlier for these datasets.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB  - In the simulation-based testing and evaluation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), how background vehicles (BVs) drive directly influences the AV's driving behavior and further affects the test results. Most existing simulation platforms use either predetermined trajectories or deterministic driving models to model BV behaviors. However, predetermined BV trajectories cannot react to AV maneuvers, and deterministic models are different from real human drivers because of the lack of stochastic components and errors. Both methods lead to unrealistic traffic scenarios. This paper presents a learning-based stochastic driving model that meets the unique needs of AV testing (i.e., interactive and human-like stochasticity). The model is built based on the long short-term memory architecture. By incorporating the concept of quantile regression into the loss function of the model, the stochastic behaviors are reproduced without prior assumption of human drivers. The model is trained with the large-scale naturalistic driving data (NDD) from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment project and compared with a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM). Analysis of individual trajectories shows that the proposed model can reproduce more similar trajectories of human drivers than IDM. To validate the ability of the proposed model in generating a naturalistic driving environment, traffic simulation experiments are implemented. The results show that traffic flow parameters such as speed, range, and time headway distribution match closely with the NDD, which is of significant importance for AV testing and evaluation.

AB  - Studying near-crashes can help safety researchers understand the nature of crashes from different perspectives. Conventional crash data sets lack information about what occurred directly before the crash event. This study used a near-crash data set extracted from a naturalistic driving study that includes features describing the vehicles, drivers, and information on other vehicles involved before and during the near-crash incidents. This data set provides us with a unique perspective to understand the patterns of near-crashes. This study applied the cluster correspondence analysis (cluster CA) algorithm to explore the patterns and the magnitude of each feature's dominance within and between the clusters through dimension reduction. The analysis identifies six clusters with four types of near-crashes: near-crash with adjacent vehicles; near-crash with the following or leading vehicles; near-crash with turning vehicles; and near-crash with objects on the roadway. The results also show that the first two types of near-crash are the most common. The patterns for these two most common types of near-crash are different with or without the engagement of secondary tasks. The findings of this study provide a fresh perspective to understand different types of crash and associated patterns. Furthermore, these findings could help transportation agencies or vehicle designers develop a more effective countermeasure to mitigate the risk of collision.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB  - Accurate prediction of the duration of traffic incidents is one of the most prominent prerequisites for effective implementation of proactive traffic incident management strategies. This paper presents a novel method for immediate prediction of traffic incident duration using an emerging supervised topic modeling. The proposed method employs natural language processing techniques for semantic text analysis of the text-based incident traffic incident dataset. The model applies the labeled latent Dirichlet allocation approach, and it is trained using 1,466 incident records collected by the Korea Expressway Corporation from 2016 to 2019. For training purposes, the proposed method divides the incidents into two groups based on the incident duration: incidents shorter than 2 h and incidents lasting 2 h or longer, following the incident management guidelines of the Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (2009). The model is tested with randomly selected incident records that were not used for the model training. The results demonstrate overall prediction accuracies of approximately 74% for incidents lasting up to 2 h, and 82% for incidents lasting 2 h or longer.

AB  - In this work, we present statistical model predictive control with Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (CLBF) built using machine learning approaches, and analyze closed-loop stability and safety properties in probability using statistical machine learning theory. A feedforward neural network (FNN) is used to construct the Control Barrier Function, and a generalization error bound can be obtained for this FNN via the Rademacher complexity method. The FNN Control Barrier Function is incorporated in a CLBFbased model predictive controller (MPC), which is used to control a nonlinear process subject to input constraints. The stability and safety properties of the closed-loop system under the sample-and-hold implementation of FNN-CLBF-MPC are evaluated in a statistical sense. We use a chemical process example to demonstrate the relation between various factors of building an FNN model and the generalization error, as well as the probabilities of closed-loop safety and stability for both bounded and unbounded unsafe sets.

AB  - Crowd counting is getting more and more attention in our daily life, because it can effectively prevent some safety problems. However, due to scale variations and background noise in the image, such as buildings and trees, getting the accurate number from image is a hard work. In order to address these problems, this work introduces a new multi-scale supervised network. The proposed model uses part of vgg16 model as the backbone to extract feature. In the training process, a multi-scale dilated convolution module is added at the end of each stage of the backbone network to generate attention map with different resolutions to help the model focus on the head area in feature map. In addition, the dilated convolution adopts three dilation ratios to fit different sizes of head in the image. Finally, in order to get the high-quality density map with high-resolution, the authors employ the upsampling operation to restore the density map size to the quarter size of original image. A large number of experiments on these four datasets show that the proposed network has greatly improved the counting accuracy of many existing methods.

AB  - Background Maternal and newborn healthcare providers are essential professional groups vulnerable to physical and psychological risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses machine learning algorithms to create a predictive tool for maternal and newborn healthcare providers' perception of being safe in the workplace globally during the pandemic. Methods We used data collected between 24 March and 5 July 2020 through a global online survey of maternal and newborn healthcare providers. The questionnaire was available in 12 languages. To predict healthcare providers' perception of safety in the workplace, we used features collected in the questionnaire, in addition to publicly available national economic and COVID-19-related factors. We built, trained and tested five machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, CatBoost and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification and regression. We extracted from RF models the relative contribution of features in output prediction. Results Models included data from 941 maternal and newborn healthcare providers from 89 countries. ML models performed well in classification and regression tasks, whereby RF had 82% cross-validated accuracy for classification, and CatBoost with 0.46 cross-validated root mean square error for regression. In both classification and regression, the most important features contributing to output prediction were classified as three themes: (1) information accessibility, clarity and quality; (2) availability of support and means of protection; and (3) COVID-19 epidemiology. Conclusion This study identified salient features contributing to maternal and newborn healthcare providers perception of safety in the workplace. The developed tool can be used by health systems globally to allow real-time learning from data collected during a health system shock. By responding in real-time to the needs of healthcare providers, health systems could prevent potential negative consequences on the quality of care offered to women and newborns.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - This article is dedicated to developing an online collision detection and identification (CDI) scheme for human-collaborative robots. The scheme is composed of a signal classifier and an online diagnosor, which monitors the sensory signals of the robot system, detects the occurrence of a physical human-robot interaction, and identifies its type within a short period. In the beginning, we conduct an experiment to construct a data set that contains the segmented physical interaction signals with ground truth. Then, we develop the signal classifier on the data set with the paradigm of supervised learning. To adapt the classifier to the online application with requirements on response time, an auxiliary online diagnosor is designed using the Bayesian decision theory. The diagnosor provides not only a collision identification result but also a confidence index which represents the reliability of the result. Compared to the previous works, the proposed scheme ensures rapid and accurate CDI even in the early stage of a physical interaction. As a result, safety mechanisms can be triggered before further injuries are caused, which is quite valuable and important toward a safe human-robot collaboration. In the end, the proposed scheme is validated on a robot manipulator and applied to a demonstration task with collision reaction strategies. The experimental results reveal that the collisions are detected and classified within 20 ms with an overall accuracy of 99.6%, which confirms the applicability of the scheme to collaborative robots in practice. Note to Practitioners-This article is intended to provide a novel online collision event handling scheme for robots in industrial environments. This scheme is designed to quickly and accurately detect an accidental collision and distinguish it from the intentional human-robot interaction. The method takes the raw signals from external torque sensors and provides a collision diagnosis result with a reliability index. The simple structure makes it easy to be implemented as a regular fault monitoring routine for collaborative robots. Different from the conventional methods, the proposed collision identification scheme in this article especially focuses on overcoming the following two challenges in practice: first, to timely and accurately report a collision within its early stage, and second, to ensure a high identification accuracy in a complicated environment, where ubiquitous disturbance and noise are unneglectable. The experimental validation at the end of this article confirms its promising application value in human-robot collaboration.

AB  - Purpose: Chest X-ray (CXR) use in pre-MRI safety screening, such as for lead-less implanted electronic device (LLIED) recognition, is common. To assist CXR interpretation, we "pre-deployed" an artificial intelligence (AI) model to assess (1) accuracies in LLIED-type (and consequently safety-level) identification, (2) safety implications of LLIED nondetections or misidentifications, (3) infrastructural or workflow requirements, and (4) demands related to model adaptation to real-world conditions.
Approach: A two-tier cascading methodology for LLIED detection/localization and identification on a frontal CXR was applied to evaluate the performance of the original nine-class AI model. With the unexpected early appearance of LLIED types during simulated real-world trialing, retraining of a newer 12-class version preceded retrialing. A zero footprint (ZF) graphical user interface (GUI)/viewer with DICOM-based output was developed for inference-result display and adjudication, supporting end-user engagement and model continuous learning and/or modernization.
Results: During model testing or trialing using both the nine-class and 12-class models, robust detection/localization was consistently 100%, with mAP 0.99 from fivefold cross-validation. Safety-level categorization was high during both testing (AUC >= 0.98 and >= 0.99, respectively) and trialing (accuracy 98% and 97%, respectively). LLIED-type identifications by the two models during testing (1) were 98.9% and 99.5% overall correct and (2) consistently showed AUC >= 0.92 (1.00 for 8/9 and 9/12 LLIED-types, respectively). Pre-deployment trialing of both models demonstrated overall type-identification accuracies of 94.5% and 95%, respectively. Of the small number of misidentifications, none involved MRI-stringently conditional or MRI-unsafe types of LLIEDs. Optimized ZF GUI/viewer operations led to greater user-friendliness for radiologist engagement.
Conclusions: Our LLIED-related AI methodology supports (1) 100% detection sensitivity, (2) high identification (including MRI-safety) accuracy, and (3) future model deployment with facilitated inference-result display and adjudication for ongoing model adaptation to future real-world experiences.

T2  - GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Introduction: In the last ten years, the medical faculty at Friedrich Schiller University Jena has reformed its traditional curriculum for human medicine. The reformed JENa professional interest-Oriented Studies (JEnaer Neigungs-Orientiertes Studium, JENOS) - with the objective to facilitate career entry through a professional interest-oriented practical approach - emerged due to the stipulation of cost neutrality.
Methods: Report on the process sequence of JENOS from the reform idea to implementation: the initial processes, the development and assessment process with accompanying dialogue and dispute of the reform process within the faculty shall be discussed. The 17 objectives of the JENOS reformed traditional curriculum shall be presented and the current level of fulfilment assessed.
Results: The structural link of the professional interest-oriented proposals was achieved through the recognition by the "Landesprufungsamt" (State Examination Board) as elective subjects with 21 semester hours (SH). Feedback and evaluations were conducted using lecturer and student information systems that were implemented in parallel. Eleven of 17 objectives have been achieved, three are still in process and three have not been achieved.
Discussion: A professional interest orientation could be achieved through the reform. The weaknesses are found primarily in the links between teaching content. These are currently undergoing a mapping process in order to be optimised.
Conclusions: Despite cost neutrality, JENOS is the successful result of reforming the curriculum. The academic reform complied with some requirements for the Master Plan 2020 for Medical Studies in order to be able to implement future changes.

AU  - Cao, X

T2  - IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
AB  - Proficiency self-assessment (PSA), which is the ability to estimate how likely one can complete a task, is a beneficial property for autonomous robots. Prior work developed the assumption-alignment tracking (AAT) method for PSA, which estimates the probability that a robot will successfully complete a task. This letter refers to the prediction made by AAT as the first-level assessment (FLA), and further proposes a second-level assessment (SLA) that determines whether the FLA prediction is correct. The probability that the FLA prediction is correct is conditioned on four features: 1) the mean distance from a test sample to its nearest neighbors in the training set; 2) the predicted probability of success made by the FLA; 3) the ratio between the robot's current performance and its performance standard; and 4) the percentage of the task the robot has already completed. The SLA model is trained on the four features using a Random Forest algorithm. It is evaluated by two metrics: discriminability, measured by the area under the ROC curve, and calibration, measured using expected calibration error. On a simulated navigation task and a manipulation task by a Sawyer robot, results demonstrate that the SLA model not only calibrates the FLA model as well as existing calibration methods (Platt calibration and isotonic regression), but also produces very high discriminability even if the FLA model's original discriminability is much lower. Results also indicate the usefulness of each of the four features used by the SLA model.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - This paper presents a probabilistic trajectory prediction of cut-in vehicles exploiting the information of interacting vehicles. First, a probability distribution of behavioral parameters, which represents the characteristics of lane-change motion, is obtained via Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). For this purpose, Gaussian Process (GP) models are trained using real-world trajectories of lane-changing vehicles and adjacent vehicles. Subsequently, the future states of the lane-change vehicle are probabilistically estimated using a path-following model, which introduces virtual measurements based on the information of behavioral parameters. The proposed predictor is applied to the motion planning and control of autonomous vehicles. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed to achieve predictive maneuvering of autonomous vehicles against cut-in preceding vehicles. The proposed predictor has been evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy. Also, the performance of the proposed predictor-based control has been validated via computer simulations and autonomous driving vehicle tests. Compared to conventional prediction methods, it is shown that the interaction-aware proposed predictor provides improved prediction of cut-in vehicles' motion in multi-vehicle scenarios. Furthermore, the control results indicate that the proposed predictor helps the autonomous vehicle to reduce the control effort and improve ride quality for passengers in cut-in scenarios, while guaranteeing safety.

AB  - It is of great interest for autonomous vehicles to predict the trajectory of other vehicles when planning a safe trajectory. To accurately predict the trajectory of the target vehicle, the interaction between vehicles must be considered. Interaction aware prediction methods track the previous trajectories of both the target vehicle and its surrounding vehicles. In this study, the authors consider trajectory prediction as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. They tackle this problem with an LSTM encoder-decoder framework. Moreover, they propose two spatial-attention mechanisms to account for the interaction between vehicles, i.e. context attention and lane attention. Spatial-attention mechanisms adopt the selective-attention mechanism of human drivers. They choose context vectors to help the model understand the surrounding environment better and thus improve its prediction accuracy. They evaluate the authors' methods on the highD data set recorded in German highways with root mean squared error metric. Their experimental results show superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/momo1986/Spatial-attention.

This study first sorts methods of CF inhibition into different categories and then investigates their effectiveness, adaptability and limitations. Considering the economic benefits and applicability, CF inhibition calls for integrated methods involving supplementary power devices, control strategies and prediction techniques. Finally, this study makes clear potential future research directions, suggesting first control potential is exploited by machine learning-based control, and then auxiliary devices to be added if necessary.

TI  - Toward Privacy Preservation Using Clustering Based Anonymization: Recent Advances and Future Research Outlook
AU  - Majeed, A

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - With the continuous increase in avenues of personal data generation, privacy protection has become a hot research topic resulting in various proposed mechanisms to address this social issue. The main technical solutions for guaranteeing a user's privacy are encryption, pseudonymization, anonymization, differential privacy (DP), and obfuscation. Despite the success of other solutions, anonymization has been widely used in commercial settings for privacy preservation because of its algorithmic simplicity and low computing overhead. It facilitates unconstrained analysis of published data that DP and the other latest techniques cannot offer, and it is a mainstream solution for responsible data science. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of clustering-based anonymization mechanisms (CAMs) that have been recently proposed to preserve both privacy and utility in data publishing. We systematically categorize the existing CAMs based on heterogeneous types of data (tables, graphs, matrixes, etc.), and we present an up-to-date, extensive review of existing CAMs and the metrics used for their evaluation. We discuss the superiority and effectiveness of CAMs over traditional anonymization mechanisms. We highlight the significance of CAMs in different computing paradigms, such as social networks, the internet of things, cloud computing, AI, and location-based systems with regard to privacy preservation. Furthermore, we present various proposed representative CAMs that compromise individual privacy, rather than safeguarding it. Besides, this article provides an extended knowledge (e.g., key assertion(s), strengths, weaknesses, clustering methods used in the anonymization process, and %age improvements in quantitative results) about each technique that provides a clear view of how much this topic has been investigated thus far, and what are the research gaps that seek pertinent solutions in the near future. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges of applying CAMs, and we suggest promising opportunities for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically cover current CAMs involving different data types and computing paradigms.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Train operation control in urban railways is challenging due to its high dynamics, complex environment, and level of comfort and safety. To address these challenges, in this article, the authors propose a new deep reinforcement-based train operation (DRTO) method which includes: 1) A deterministic deep reinforcement learning algorithm, 2) a dynamic incentive system, which is used to ensure safe operation in a multitrain environment, and 3) an event-driven method, which is used to improve the DRTO performance based on an event-driven strategy. To evaluate the performance, we thoroughly compare the proposed method with other operation control solutions on both synthetic and real datasets. Our results demonstrate that DRTO is effective in: 1) Decreasing the energy consumption of train operation, 2) increasing passenger comfort, and 3) achieving a good tradeoff between efficiency and safety. In addition, the effectiveness of the event-driven strategy and the dynamic incentive system is demonstrated in the experiments.

T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
AB  - To enhance the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in online retail operations and avoid succumbing to digital myopia, marketers need to be aware of the different approaches to utilizing AI/ML in terms of the information they make available to appropriate groups of consumers. This can be viewed as utilizing AI/ML to improve the customer journey experience. Reflecting on this, the main question to be addressed is: how can retailers utilize big data through the implementation of AI/ML to improve the efficiency of their marketing operations so that customers feel safe buying online? To answer this question, we conducted a systematic literature review and posed several subquestions that resulted in insights into why marketers need to pay specific attention to AI/ML capability. We explain how different AI/ML tools/functionalities can be related to different stages of the AIDA (Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action) model, which in turn helps retailers to recognize potential opportunities as well as increase consumer confidence. We outline how digital myopia can be reduced by focusing on human inputs. Although challenges still exist, it is clear that retailers need to identify the boundaries in terms of AI/ML's ability to enhance the company's business model.

AU  - Mozaffari, A

AU  - Azad, NL
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
AB  - In this investigation, an advanced modeling method, called online sequential extreme learning machine with a hyper-level fault tolerance-based supervisor (OSELM-FTS), is utilized to develop a robust safety-oriented autonomous cruise control based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique. The resulting MPC-based cruise controller is used to improve the driving safety and reduce the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV). The structural flexibility of OSELM-FTS allows us to not only improve the operating features of the EV, but also develop an intelligent supervisor which can detect any operating fault and send proper commands for the adaption of the MPC controller. This introduces a degree of robustness to the devised controller, as OSELM-FTS automatically detects and filters any operating faults which may undermine the performance of the MPC controller. To ascertain the veracity of the devised controller, three well-known MPC formulations, i.e. linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and diagonal recurrent neural network MPC (DRNN-MPC), are applied to the baseline EV and their performances are compared with OSELM-FTS-MPC. To further elaborate on the computational advantages of OSELM, a well-known chunk-by-chunk incremental machine learning approach, namely selective negative correlation learning (SNCL), is taken into account. The results of the comparative study indicate that OSELM-FTS-MPC is a very promising control scheme and can be reliably used for safety-oriented autonomous cruise control of the EVs.

TI  - A Simple Yet Robust Algorithm for Automatic Extraction of Parallel Sentences: A Case Study on Arabic-English Wikipedia Articles
AU  - Althobaiti, MJ
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Parallel corpora are vital components in several applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in machine translation. In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically creating parallel sentences from comparable corpora. The method requires a bilingual dictionary as well as an adequate word-vectorisation method. We use Arabic and English Wikipedia as a comparable corpus to apply our proposed method and construct a parallel corpus between Arabic and English. The created Arabic-English corpus consists of 105,010 parallel sentences with a total number of 4.6M words. During our study, we compared two methods of word vectorisation, word embedding and term frequency-inverse document frequency, in terms of their usefulness in computing similarities between well-formed and syntactically ill-formed sentences. We also quantitatively and qualitatively examined the parallel corpus produced by our proposed method and compared it with other available Arabic-English parallel corpora counterparts: GlobalVoices, TED, and Wiki-OPUS. We explored the main advantages and shortcomings of these corpora when used for NLP applications, such as word semantic similarity identification and Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The word semantic similarity models trained on our parallel corpus outperformed models trained on other corpora in the task of English non-similar word identification. Our parallel corpus also proved competitive when building Arabic-English NMT systems, yielding results comparable to those of the automatically created Wiki-OPUS corpus and of the manually created TED corpus, while achieving results superior to the smaller GlobalVoices corpus.

TI  - Regulating for 'Normal Al Accidents': Operational Lessons for the Responsible Governance of Artificial Intelligence Deployment
AU  - Maas, MM

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 AAAI/ACM CONFERENCE ON AI, ETHICS, AND SOCIETY (AIES'18)
AB  - New technologies, particularly those which are deployed rapidly across sectors, or which have to operate in competitive conditions, can disrupt previously stable technology governance regimes. This leads to a precarious need to balance caution against performance while exploring the resulting 'safe operating space'. This paper will argue that Artificial Intelligence is one such critical technology, the responsible deployment of which is likely to prove especially complex, because even narrow AI applications often involve networked (tightly coupled, opaque) systems operating in complex or competitive environments. This ensures such systems are prone to 'normal accident'-type failures which can cascade rapidly, and are hard to contain or even detect in time. Legal and governance approaches to the deployment of AI will have to reckon with the specific causes and features of such `normal accidents'. While this suggests that large-scale, cascading errors in AI systems are inevitable, an examination of the operational features that lead technologies to exhibit 'normal accidents' enables us to derive both tentative principles for precautionary policymaking, and practical recommendations for the safe(r) deployment of AI systems. This may help enhance the safety and security of these systems in the public sphere, both in the short- and in the long term.

AB  - The automation of railroad operations is a rapidly growing industry. In 2023, a new European standard for the automated Grade of Automation (GoA) 2 over European Train Control System (ETCS) driving is anticipated. Meanwhile, railway stakeholders are already planning their research initiatives for driverless and unattended autonomous driving systems. As a result, the industry is particularly active in research regarding perception technologies based on Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with outstanding results at the application level. However, executing high-performance and safety-critical applications on embedded systems and in real-time is a challenge. There are not many commercially available solutions, since High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms are typically seen as being beyond the business of safety-critical systems. This work proposes a novel safety-critical and high-performance computing platform for CV- and AI-enhanced technology execution used for automatic accurate stopping and safe passenger transfer railway functionalities. The resulting computing platform is compatible with the majority of widely-used AI inference methodologies, AI model architectures, and AI model formats thanks to its design, which enables process separation, redundant execution, and HW acceleration in a transparent manner. The proposed technology increases the portability of railway applications into embedded systems, isolates crucial operations, and effectively and securely maintains system resources.

AB  - Construction equipment operations that require high levels of attention can cause mental fatigue, which can lead to inefficiencies and accidents. Previous studies classified mental fatigue using single-modal data with acceptable accuracy. However, mental fatigue is a multimodal problem, and no single modality is superior. Moreover, none of the previous studies in construction industry have investigated multimodal data fusion for classifying mental fatigue and whether such an approach would improve mental fatigue detection. This study proposes a novel approach using three machine learning models and multimodal data fusion to classify mental fatigue states. Electroencephalography, electrodermal activity, and video signals were acquired during an excavation operation, and the decision tree model using multimodal sensor data fusion outperformed other models with 96.2% accuracy and 96.175%-98.231% F1 scores. Multimodal sensor data fusion can aid in the development of a realtime system to classify mental fatigue and improve safety management at construction sites.

TI  - Learning the representation of surrogate safety measures to identify traffic conflict

T2  - ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB  - Traffic conflict can be identified by the presence of evasive actions or the amount of temporal (spatial) proximity measures like time-to-collision (TTC). However, it is not enough to use only one kind of measures in some scenarios and it is hard to set a threshold for those measures. This paper proposed a method to identify traffic conflict by learning the representation of TTC and driver maneuver profiles with deep unsupervised learning and clustering the representations into traffic conflict and non-conflict clusters. We first trained a transformer encoder to encode sequences of surrogate safety measures into some latent space with unsupervised pre-training. Second, we identified informative clusters in the latent space by calculating the statistic summaries and visualizing trajectory pairs of each cluster. Some clusters are interpreted as traffic conflict clusters because they have small TTC, large deceleration rate and intertwining trajectories and they can be further interpreted as rear-end or angle conflicts. Moreover, the identified traffic conflicts contain critical conditions from the two vehicles in an interaction and one vehicle perceives them as abnormal and takes evasive action to avoid crashes.

TI  - Using machine learning methods in airline flight data monitoring to generate new operational safety knowledge from existing data
AU  - Oehling, J
AU  - Barry, DJ
T2  - SAFETY SCIENCE
AB  - The aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of using machine learning (ML) methods in order to generate novel, safety-relevant knowledge from existing flight data. Airlines routinely generate vast amounts of flight data from routine monitoring, but the concept of extracting safety knowledge from this data is still based on detecting exceedances of expert-defined thresholds. This system is conceptually unable to detect novel occurrences for which no such filters exist. ML techniques are able to close this gap.
This paper first reviews the literature to select an appropriate ML method. A form of unsupervised learning called "Local Outlier Probability" is selected. Next, an appropriate feature space is developed and implemented in the flight data monitoring system of a supporting airline to generate the dataset. This dataset is cleaned and the outlier calculation performed. The results are statistically analysed. Furthermore, the top outliers are reviewed by the airline's review pilots in the same way as the traditional exceedance events. Last, the severities and safety relevance of both types of events are compared.
This work successfully shows that the chosen approach is able to reduce the number of undetected safety-relevant occurrences by finding novel occurrence types which were undetected by a contemporary and mature flight data monitoring system.
This research builds on recent literature by developing a novel method which can be scaled to work in an airline production environment with large datasets, as demonstrated by the efficient analysis of 1.2 million flights.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - In peak hours, when the limited transportation capacity of urban rail transit is not adequate enough to meet the travel demands, the density of the passengers waiting at the platform can exceed the critical density of the platform. Coordinated passenger inflow control strategy is required to adjust/meter the inflow volume and relieve some of the demand pressure at crowded metro stations so as to ensure both operational efficiency and safety at such stations for all passengers. However, such strategy is usually developed by the operation staff at each station based on their practical working experience. As such, the best strategy/decision cannot always be made and sometimes can even be highly undesirable due to their inability to account for the dynamic performance of all metro stations in the entire rail transit network. In this paper, a new reinforcement learning-based method is developed to optimize the inflow volume during a certain period of time at each station with the aim of minimizing the safety risks imposed on passengers at the metro stations. Basic principles and fundamental components of the reinforcement learning, as well as the reinforcement learning-based problem-specific algorithm are presented. The simulation experiment carried out on a real-world metro line in Shanghai is constructed to test the performance of the approach. Simulation results show that the reinforcement learning based inflow volume control strategy is highly effective in minimizing the safety risks by reducing the frequency of passengers being stranded. Additionally, the strategy also helps to relieve the passenger congestion at certain stations.

AB  - This paper presents a big data analytics method for the evaluation of ship-ship collision risk in real operational conditions. The approach makes use of big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and nowcast data corresponding to time-dependent traffic situations and hydro-meteorological conditions respectively. An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB  - PurposeDespite all the recent achievements in the field of interactive marketing and artificial intelligence (AI), it is important to consider the ethical implications of these technologies. This paper explains the concept of corporate digital responsibility (CDR) and how it is affected by new advances in AI.Design/methodology/approachThe authors build on the work of Wirtz et al., (2023) and derive several managerial implications for the challenges that AI poses to CDR. CDR refers to a service company's ethical and fair use of data and technology within its digital service ecosystem. It involves establishing standards, protecting customer privacy, conducting external audits and striving for an equitable power dynamic between service firms and their partners.FindingsDespite the risks involved, many companies are not prioritizing good CDR practices. Financial benefits from the collection and use of consumer data, improved customer experience through AI-driven customization and personalization, cost reduction through service automation and the trade-offs between organizational goals and CDR practices can prevent companies from prioritizing good CDR practices.Originality/valueThis is one of the first articles in the service domain to take the concept of CDR and apply it to recent developments in generative AI.Research limitations/implicationsThe emergence of powerful AI tools presents opportunities and challenges. Research opportunities include responsible business restructuring, responsible service automation to ensure fairness and human oversight, addressing dehumanization of service delivery, responsible customer profiling to address privacy and discrimination concerns and preventing AI misuse.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES
AB  - Learning from previous events represents a crucial element to improve the design and operations of industrial processes, especially considering the many variables characterizing the functioning of a plant. This learning process aims to reduce the frequency of incidents and/or mitigate their severity, which are both continuous and open challenges. This paper is grounded on a large incident repository, i.e., the Major Hazard Incident Data Service (MHIDAS) database, which was developed in 1986 by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to provide a reliable source of data on major hazard incidents involving hazardous materials. The database includes more than 9000 reports collected over five decades (1950s-1990s). This paper aims to provide a novel understanding of the industrial incidents reported in MHIDAS and unveil possible ways of exploring occupational/operational incidents through descriptive and quantitative analyses. Consequently, this paper proposes the implementation of Business Intelligence (BI) tools to facilitate dynamic data visualization and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the extraction of knowledge from different data entries. Therefore, after engineering the MHIDAS data model, a set of BI dashboards was designed and complemented with a ML-driven categorization of incidents through representative key variables for occupational/operational incidents. The manuscript describes the process necessary to create a BI model for safety data management in an industrial context, and its integration with ML solutions that may support an in-depth multi-variate investigation of reported data. The investigation provides evidence on the importance of a precise reporting of safety events, thus unveiling the potential for lessons learned in the process industry.

AB  - Flight safety is a hot topic in the aviation industry. Statistics show that safety incidents during landing are closely related to the flare phase because this critical period requires extensive pilot operations. Many airlines require that pilots should avoid performing any forward stick inputs during the flare. However, our statistical results from about 86,504 flights show that this unsafe pilot operation occasionally happens. Although several case studies were conducted previously, systematic research, especially based on a large volume of flight data, is still missing. This paper aims to fill this gap and provide more insights into the issue of pilots' unsafe stick operations during the flare phase. Specifically, our work is based on the Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data, which consist of multivariate time-series data from various flight parameters. The raw data were carefully preprocessed, then key features were extracted based on flight expert experience, and a K-means clustering algorithm was utilized to divide the unsafe pilot operations into four categories. Based on the clustering results, we conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover the reasons for different types of unsafe pilot stick operations. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted to further investigate how these unsafe operations are correlated with different factors, including airlines, airports, and pilots. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study analyzing pilots' unsafe forward stick operations based on a large volume of flight data. The findings can be used by airlines to design more targeted pilot training programs in the future.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Today's organisations are facing a number of challenges, one of the most significant of which is ensuring the safety of their digital data. This is as a result of the fact that they are frequently faced with internal and external threats that can put the data they have been entrusted with in jeopardy of being compromised. As a result of this, this study investigates the dimension of threats associated to unintentional internal user of an organisation and utilises NARX to model and test a detection scheme associated to the menace. In addition, this study aims to provide a better understanding of the current state of the threat landscape. The data adopted for this research is primarily a "user activity logs" dataset from CERT (release version r4.2). From the data, the study conceptualized "Access", "Motivation", and "Action" to be the key dimensions influencing "insider", whereas "Intent", "+Action", "Method", and "knowledge" are the key dimension influencing "threats". Experimental analyses conducted by NARX within several numbers of partitions of the data point to a good detection capacity, with the greatest value of R2 coming in at 0.97. This indicates that NARX was able to detect the crucial dimension that was formulated for by the research to be the detections parameter of an inadvertent insider threat when operating under the best partition. In light of these findings, organisations can use the proposed approach to assess their preparedness for Insider attacks.

AB  - Background Operating room (OR) fires are rare but devastating events requiring immediate and effective response. Virtual Reality (VR) simulation training can provide a safe environment for practice of skills in such highly stressful situation. This study assessed interprofessional participants' ability to respond to VR-simulated OR fire scenarios, attitudes, numbers of attempt of the VR simulation do participants need to successfully respond to OR fires and does prior experience, confidence level, or professional role predict the number of attempts needed to demonstrate safety and pass the simulation. Methods 180 surgical team members volunteered to participate in this study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. Each participant completed five VR OR simulation trials; the final two trials incorporated AI assistance. Primary outcomes were performance scores, number of attempts needed to pass, and pre- and post-survey results describing participant confidence and experiences. Differences across professional or training role were assessed using chi-square tests and analyses of variance. Differences in pass rates over time were assessed using repeated measures logistic regression. Results One hundred eighty participants completed simulation testing; 170 (94.4%) completed surveys. Participants included surgeons (17.2%), anesthesiologists (10.0%), allied health professionals (41.7%), and medical trainees (31.1%). Prior to training, 45.4% of participants reported feeling moderately or very confident in their ability to respond to an OR fire. Eight participants (4.4%) responded safely on the first simulation attempt. Forty-three participants (23.9%) passed by the third attempt (VR only); an additional 97 participants (53.9%) passed within the 4-5th attempt (VR with AI assistance). Conclusions Providers are unprepared to respond to OR fires. VR-based simulation training provides a practical platform for individuals to improve their knowledge and performance in the management of OR fires with a 79% pass rate in our study. A VR AI approach to teaching this essential skill is innovative, feasible, and effective.

AB  - The detection of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a crucial task for drug safety surveillance, which provides effective and safe co-prescriptions of multiple drugs. Since laboratory researches are often complicated, costly and time-consuming, it's urgent to develop computational approaches to detect drug-drug interactions. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art computational methods falling into three categories: literature-based extraction methods, machine learning-based prediction methods and pharmacovigilance-based data mining methods. Literature-based extraction methods detect DDIs from published literature using natural language processing techniques; machine learning-based prediction methods build prediction models based on the known DDIs in databases and predict novel ones; pharmacovigilance-based data mining methods usually apply statistical techniques on various electronic data to detect drug-drug interaction signals. We first present the taxonomy of drug-drug interaction detection methods and provide the outlines of three categories of methods. Afterwards, we respectively introduce research backgrounds and data sources of three categories, and illustrate their representative approaches as well as evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of existing methods and highlight potential opportunities for future directions.

AB  - Retained surgical items (RSIs) in patients is a major operating room (OR) patient safety concern. An RSI is any surgical tool, sponge, needle or other item inadvertently left in a patients body during the course of surgery. If left undetected, RSIs may lead to serious negative health consequences such as sepsis, internal bleeding, and even death. To help physicians efficiently and effectively detect RSIs, we are developing computer-aided detection (CADe) software for X-ray (XR) image analysis, utilizing large amounts of currently available image data to produce a clinically effective RSI detection system. Physician analysis of XRs for the purpose of RSI detection is a relatively lengthy process that may take up to 45 minutes to complete. It is also error prone due to the relatively low acuity of the human eye for RSIs in XR images. The system we are developing is based on computer vision and machine learning algorithms. We address the problem of low incidence by proposing synthesis algorithms. The CADe software we are developing may be integrated into a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), be implemented as a stand-alone software application, or be integrated into portable XR machine software through application programming interfaces. Preliminary experimental results on actual XR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Technological Answerability and the Severance Problem: Staying Connected by Demanding Answers
AU  - Tigard, DW
T2  - SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies have become nearly ubiquitous. In some ways, the developments have likely helped us, but in other ways sophisticated technologies set back our interests. Among the latter sort is what has been dubbed the 'severance problem'-the idea that technologies sever our connection to the world, a connection which is necessary for us to flourish and live meaningful lives. I grant that the severance problem is a threat we should mitigate and I ask: how can we stave it off? In particular, the fact that some technologies exhibit behavior that is unclear to us seems to constitute a kind of severance. Building upon contemporary work on moral responsibility, I argue for a mechanism I refer to as 'technological answerability', namely the capacity to recognize human demands for answers and to respond accordingly. By designing select devices-such as robotic assistants and personal AI programs-for increased answerability, we see at least one way of satisfying our demands for answers and thereby retaining our connection to a world increasingly occupied by technology.

AB  - Every year, thousands of people receive consumer product related injuries. Research indicates that online customer reviews can be processed to autonomously identify product safety issues. Early identification of safety issues can lead to earlier recalls, and thus fewer injuries and deaths. A dataset of product reviews from Amazon.com was compiled, along with SaferProducts.gov complaints and recall descriptions from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and European Commission Rapid Alert system. A system was built to clean the collected text and to extract relevant features. Dimensionality reduction was performed by computing feature relevance through a Random Forest and discarding features with low information gain. Various classifiers were analyzed, including Logistic Regression, SVMs, Naive-Bayes, Random Forests, and an Ensemble classifier. Experimentation with various features and classifier combinations resulted in a logistic regression model with 66% precision in the top 50 reviews surfaced. This classifier outperforms all benchmarks set by related literature and consumer product safety professionals.

TI  - A practical Reinforcement Learning implementation approach for continuous process control
AU  - Patel, KM
T2  - COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Industrial process control using model-based technologies is well established. These technologies are typically non-adaptive and so have limitations. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a model-free adaptive alternative. RL is a type of machine learning (ML) where models or data sets of the environment are not necessary before learning can start. It generates data, by exploring the environment and then learn the behavior from it. Though RL has been successfully applied for learning and playing various games such as Go, Chess, Atari; its application to continuous process control problems is not trivial. There is a need for online RL implementation to be safe, fast learning and explainable when applied to industrial control problems. Rather than adding to the extensive research on augmenting existing RL algorithms, the paper presents a unique systematic method of formulating the RL problem incorporating domain-specific knowledge about process constraints and objectives, resulting in reduced dimensionality, along with modifications to the exploration process, applicable to any model free RL algorithm supporting continuous states and actions, to enhance safety, speed and explainability of online RL implementation without requiring a simulation model. The approach is successfully implemented on two multivariable processes: a simulated distillation column and a temperature control lab setup using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The work demonstrates that the presented method is applicable to multivariable, noisy, non-linear processes with disturbances. It will further the potential of introducing the advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms for intelligent process control capable of enabling autonomous operation in the process industry.

AB  - The integration of industrial robots into the human workspace presents a set of unique challenges. This paper introduces a new sensory system for modeling, tracking, and predicting human motions within a robot workspace. A reactive control scheme to modify a robot's operations for accommodating the presence of the human within the robot workspace is also presented. To this end, a special class of artificial neural networks, namely, self-organizing maps (SOMs), is employed for obtaining a superquadric-based model of the human. The SOM network receives information of the human's footprints from the sensory system and infers necessary data for rendering the human model. The model is then used in order to assess the danger of the robot operations based on the measured as well as predicted human motions. This is followed by the introduction of a new reactive control scheme that results in the least interferences between the human and robot operations. The approach enables the robot to foresee an upcoming danger and take preventive actions before the danger becomes imminent. Simulation and experimental results are presented in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AU  - Mizuno, S

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
AB  - This study has proposed a method for detecting turbulence, a primary factor that influences safe aircraft operation. The number of observed turbulence events is limited, thereby indicating the requirement of an appropriate flow for detecting turbulence events from a small number of samples. In addition, the opinions and experiences of pilots must be reflected at the initial stage to address the high risk of turbulence occurrence, which can result in airline operations being cancelled. Thus, this study proposed a method for predicting turbulence occurrence based on the turbulence occurrence date information provided by airlines as well as meteorological data sets obtained from open data available in Japan as teacher data. However, because commonly used machine learning methods are unable to detect the turbulence occurrence date, the proposed method employed principal component analysis coupled with the K-Means method to generate risk clusters with a high likelihood of turbulence occurrence and consequently perform statistical checks. Subsequently, the risk clusters were utilized as supervisory data for turbulence occurrence, while the support vector machine was used for predicting turbulence occurrence. Furthermore, the results obtained with the proposed method were statistically checked as well as practically verified by a pilot to confirm the appropriateness of the turbulence occurrence date predicted.

AB  - Purpose
Because of the increased use of robots in the industry, it has become inevitable for humans and robots to be able to work together. Therefore, human security has become the primary noncompromising factor of joint human and robot operations. For this reason, the purpose of this study was to develop a safe human-robot interaction software based on vision and touch.
Design/methodology/approach
The software consists of three modules. Firstly, the vision module has two tasks: to determine whether there is a human presence and to measure the distance between the robot and the human within the robot's working space using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and depth sensors. Secondly, the touch detection module perceives whether or not a human physically touches the robot within the same work environment using robot axis torques, wavelet packet decomposition algorithm and CNN. Lastly, the robot's operating speed is adjusted according to hazard levels came from vision and touch module using the robot's control module.
Findings
The developed software was tested with an industrial robot manipulator and successful results were obtained with minimal error.
Originality/value
In this study, a new and practical safety algorithm is proposed and the health of people working with industrial robots is guaranteed.

AB  - Aiming at human-robot collaboration in manufacturing, the operator's safety is the primary issue during the manufacturing operations. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach to realize the real-time collision-free motion planning of an industrial robot for human-robot collaboration. Firstly, the safe human robot collaboration manufacturing problem is formulated into a Markov decision process, and the mathematical expression of the reward function design problem is given. The goal is that the robot can autonomously learn a policy to reduce the accumulated risk and assure the task completion time during human-robot collaboration. To transform our optimization object into a reward function to guide the robot to learn the expected behaviour, a reward function optimizing approach based on the deterministic policy gradient is proposed to learn a parameterized intrinsic reward function. The reward function for the agent to learn the policy is the sum of the intrinsic reward function and the extrinsic reward function. Then, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm intrinsic reward-deep deterministic policy gradient (IRDDPG), which is the combination of the DDPG algorithm and the reward function optimizing approach, is proposed to learn the expected collision avoidance policy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested in a simulation environment, and the results show that the industrial robot can learn the expected policy to achieve the safety assurance for industrial human-robot collaboration without missing the original target. Moreover, the reward function optimizing approach can help make up for the designed reward function and improve policy performance.

AB  - Online Social Networks (OSNs), together with messaging services are tools for the exchange of entertainment-related information. However, they represent virtual environments capable of providing relevant information related to emergency or criminal events. Thanks to the simple way of using OSNs in combination to modern ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices, the generation and exploitation of such information is made available to users in real-time even more easily. Unfortunately, its reuse has not been taken into consideration yet due to the lack of specific models and related software tools. In this context, the paper presents a social media-based over layer for supporting the monitoring, detection, computation and information sharing of social media information related to emergency scenarios centered on smartphones and text mining techniques. The proposal is assessed through two different case studies, by evaluating the performances of different classifiers and by showing the logic of the functionalities of the related apps.

AB  - The accurate estimation of airspace capacity in unmanned traffic management (UTM) operations is critical for a safe, efficient, and equitable allocation of airspace system resources. While conventional approaches for assessing airspace complexity certainly exist, these methods fail to capture true airspace capacity, since they fail to address several important variables (such as weather). Meanwhile, existing AI-based decision-support systems evince opacity and inexplicability, and this restricts their practical application. With these challenges in mind, the authors propose a tailored solution to the needs of demand and capacity management (DCM) services. This solution, by deploying a synthesized fuzzy rule-based model and deep learning will address the trade-off between explicability and performance. In doing so, it will generate an intelligent system that will be explicable and reasonably comprehensible. The results show that this advisory system will be able to indicate the most appropriate regions for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) operation, and it will also increase UTM airspace availability by more than 23%. Moreover, the proposed system demonstrates a maximum capacity gain of 65% and a minimum safety gain of 35%, while possessing an explainability attribute of 70%. This will assist UTM authorities through more effective airspace capacity estimation and the formulation of new operational regulations and performance requirements.

AB  - This research reviews the current literature on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the operation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This paper examines three key aspects in developing the future of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and UAV operations: (i) design, (ii) human factors, and (iii) operation process. The use of widely accepted frameworks such as the "Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS)" and "ObserveOrient-Decide- Act (OODA)" loops are discussed. The comprehensive review of this research found that as autonomy increases, operator cognitive workload decreases and situation awareness improves, but also found a corresponding decline in operator vigilance and an increase in trust in the AI system. These results provide valuable insights and opportunities for improving the safety and efficiency of autonomous UAVs in the future and suggest the need to include human factors in the development process.

AB  - With the ubiquitous deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in low latency mission critical applications, there has been an extensive proliferation of custom-built AI inference accelerators at the edge. Drastic technology scaling in recent years has made these circuits highly vulnerable to faults due to various reasons like aging, latent defects, single event upsets, etc. Such faults are highly detrimental to the classification accuracy of the AI accelerator, leading to the critical Functional Safety (FuSa) violation, when used in mission-critical applications. In order to detect such violations in mission mode, we analyze the efficiency of a software-based self test scheme that employs functional test patterns, akin to instances in the application dataset. Such patterns are either selected from the dataset of the DNN, or generated from scratch utilizing the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). When evaluated on state-of-the-art DNNs on multivariate exhaustive datasets, the GAN generated test patterns significantly improve FuSa violation detection coverage by up to 130.28%, compared to the selected test patterns, thereby accomplishing efficient testing of the AI accelerator, online, in mission mode.

AB  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers have generated excitement within the control community. The primary advantage of RL controllers relative to existing methods is their ability to optimize uncertain systems independently of explicit assumption of process uncertainty. Recent focus on engineering applications has been directed towards the development of safe RL controllers. Previous works have proposed approaches to account for constraint satisfaction through constraint tightening from the domain of stochastic model predictive control. Here, we extend these approaches to account for plant-model mismatch. Specifically, we propose a data-driven approach that utilizes Gaussian processes for the offline simulation model and use the associated posterior uncertainty prediction to account for joint chance constraints and plant-model mismatch. The method is benchmarked against nonlinear model predictive control via case studies. The results demonstrate the ability of the methodology to account for process uncertainty, enabling satisfaction of joint chance constraints even in the presence of plant-model mismatch.

TI  - Artificial Moral Responsibility: How We Can and Cannot Hold Machines Responsible
AU  - Tigard, DW
T2  - CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY OF HEALTHCARE ETHICS
AB  - Our ability to locate moral responsibility is often thought to be a necessary condition for conducting morally permissible medical practice, engaging in a just war, and other high-stakes endeavors. Yet, with increasing reliance upon artificially intelligent systems, we may be facing a widening responsibility gap, which, some argue, cannot be bridged by traditional concepts of responsibility. How then, if at all, can we make use of crucial emerging technologies? According to Colin Allen and Wendell Wallach, the advent of so-called 'artificial moral agents' (AMAs) is inevitable. Still, this notion may seem to push back the problem, leaving those who have an interest in developing autonomous technology with a dilemma. We may need to scale-back our efforts at deploying AMAs (or at least maintain human oversight); otherwise, we must rapidly and drastically update our moral and legal norms in a way that ensures responsibility for potentially avoidable harms. This paper invokes contemporary accounts of responsibility in order to show how artificially intelligent systems might be held responsible. Although many theorists are concerned enough to develop artificial conceptions of agency or to exploit our present inability to regulate valuable innovations, the proposal here highlights the importance of-and outlines a plausible foundation for-a workable notion of artificial moral responsibility.

AB  - Online gaming no longer has limited access, as it has become available to a high percentage of children in recent years. Consequently, children are exposed to multifaceted threats, such as cyberbullying, grooming, and sexting. Although the online gaming industry is taking concerted measures to create a safe environment for children to play and interact with, such efforts remain inadequate and fragmented. There is a vital need to develop laws and policies to regulate and build minimum standards for the industry to safeguard and protect children online on the one hand, while promoting innovations in the gaming industry to preempt such threats. Many tools have been adapted to control threats against children in the form of content filtering and parental controls, thereby restricting contact with children to protect them from child predators. Different approaches utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to detect child predatory behavior have been designed to provide potential detection and protection in this context. In this paper, we survey online threats to children in the gaming environment and present the limitations of existing solutions that address these threats. We also aimed to present the challenges that ML techniques face in protecting children against predatory behavior by presenting a systematic review of the available techniques in the literature. Therefore, this analysis provides not only recommendations to stakeholders to develop policies and practices that safeguard children when gaming, but also to the gaming industry to continue providing appropriate measures for a safe and entertaining gaming environment.

AB  - Safety is essential for deploying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in real-world scenarios. Recently, verification approaches have been proposed to allow quantifying the number of violations of a DRL policy over input-output relationships, called properties. However, such properties are hard-coded and require task-level knowledge, making their application intractable in challenging safety-critical tasks. To this end, we introduce the Collection and Refinement of Online Properties (CROP) framework to design properties at training time. CROP employs a cost signal to identify unsafe interactions and use them to shape safety properties. Hence, we propose a refinement strategy to combine properties that model similar unsafe interactions. Our evaluation compares the benefits of computing the number of violations using standard hard-coded properties and the ones generated with CROP. We evaluate our approach in several robotic mapless navigation tasks and demonstrate that the violation metric computed with CROP allows higher returns and lower violations over previous Safe DRL approaches.

However, it is not known whether some hybrid approach that combines advantages of these fundamentally different solution categories could be superior to them in this context. This paper presents the first hybrid solution HyLEAP for collision-free navigation of self-driving cars together with a comparative experimental performance evaluation over the first benchmark OpenDS-CTS of simulated car-pedestrian accident scenarios based on the major German in-depth road accident study GIDAS. Our experiments revealed that HyLEAP can outperform each of its integrated state of the art methods for approximate POMDP planning and deep reinforcement learning in most GIDAS accident scenarios regarding safety, while they appear to be equally competitive regarding smoothness of driving and time to goal on average.

AB  - Industrial robots are versatile machines that can be used to implement numerous tasks. They have been successful in applications where-after integration and commissioning-a more or less static and repetitive behaviour in conjunction with closed work cells is sufficient. In aerospace manufacturing, robots still struggle to compete against either specialized machines or manual labour. This can be attributed to complex or custom parts and/or small batch sizes. Here, applicability of robots can be improved by enabling collaborative use-cases. When fixed protective fences are not desired due to handling problems of the large parts involved, sensor-based approaches like speed and separation monitoring (SSM) are required. This contribution is about how to construct dynamic volumes of space around a robot as well as around a person in the way that their combination satisfies required separation distance between robot and person. The goal was to minimize said distance by calculating volumes both adaptively and as precisely as possible given the available information. We used a voxel-based method to compute the robot safety space that includes worst-case breaking behaviour. We focused on providing a worst-case representation considering all possible breaking variations. Our approach to generate the person safety space is based on an outlook for 2D camera, AI-based workspace surveillance.

AB  - Cyberbullying on social media continues to pose a significant problem for children and young people, and platforms increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to address it. Nonetheless, little is known about children's views as to the effectiveness of AI-based interventions; and how these interventions impact their rights to protection, privacy, and freedom of expression, as afforded to them in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which applies in a digital environment. This study is the first to ask children about their perceptions as to how AI-based proactive content moderation of cyberbullying impacts their rights. We have designed a set of AI-based interventions into cyberbullying that build on proactive content take-down, based on social learning and social norm theories; we solicited children's views via focus groups and in-depth interviews as to their perceived effectiveness and impact of such interventions on children's rights (children from Ireland, age 12-17, N = 59). We discuss how youth social norms can limit the effectiveness of the interventions and the need to involve youth in platform decisions regarding AI design.

AB  - ChatGPT is a highly advanced AI language model that has gained widespread popularity. It is trained to understand and generate human language and is used in various applications, including automated customer service, chatbots, and content generation. While it has the potential to offer many benefits, there are also concerns about its potential for misuse, particularly in relation to providing inappropriate or harmful safety-related information. To explore ChatGPT's (specifically version 3.5) capabilities in providing safety-related advice, a multidisciplinary consortium of experts was formed to analyse nine cases across different safety domains: using mobile phones while driving, supervising children around water, crowd management guidelines, precautions to prevent falls in older people, air pollution when exercising, intervening when a colleague is distressed, managing job demands to prevent burnout, protecting personal data in fitness apps, and fatigue when operating heavy machinery. The experts concluded that there is potential for significant risks when using ChatGPT as a source of information and advice for safety-related issues. ChatGPT provided incorrect or potentially harmful statements and emphasised individual responsibility, potentially leading to ecological fallacy. The study highlights the need for caution when using ChatGPT for safety-related information and expert verification, as well as the need for ethical considerations and safeguards to ensure users understand the limitations and receive appropriate advice, especially in low-and middle-income countries. The results of this investigation serve as a reminder that while AI technology continues to advance, caution must be exercised to ensure that its applications do not pose a threat to public safety.

TI  - Safe, Fast and Explainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Process Control
AU  - Patel, KM
T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCED CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES (ADCONIP 2022)
AB  - Industrial process control using model-based technologies is well established. These technologies are typically non-adaptive and so have limitations. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a model-free adaptive alternative. RL is a type of machine learning (ML) where models or data sets of the environment are not necessary before learning can start. It generates data, by exploring the environment and then learn the behavior from it. Though RL has been successfully applied for learning and playing various games such as Go, Chess, Atari; its application to continuous process control problems is not trivial. There is a need for online RL implementation to be safe, fast learning and explainable when applied to industrial control problems. Rather than adding to the extensive research on augmenting existing RL algorithms, the work focuses on developing a unique systematic method of formulating the RL problem incorporating domain-specific knowledge about process constraints and objectives, reducing dimensionality and modifying the exploration process, applicable to any model free RL algorithm supporting continuous states and actions, to enhance safety, speed and explainability of online RL implementation without requiring a simulation model. The approach is successfully implemented on two multivariable processes: a simulated distillation column and a temperature control lab setup using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The work demonstrates that the developed method is applicable to multivariable, noisy, non-linear processes with disturbances. It will further the potential of introducing the advances in Artificial Intelligence and ML algorithms for intelligent process control capable of enabling autonomous operation in the process industry.

T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - While being a fundamental driver of competitiveness in agroindustry, technological innovation has also introduced new critical elements related, for example, to the sustainability of the production processes as well as to the safety of workers. In such regard, the advent of the 4th industrial revolution (Agriculture 4.0) based on digitalization, is an unprecedented opportunity of rethinking the role of innovation in a new human-centric perspective. In particular, the establishment of an interconnected work environment and the augmentation of the operator's physical, sensorial, and cognitive capabilities, are two technologies which can be effectively employed for substantially improving the ergonomics and safety conditions on the workplace. This paper approaches such topic referring to the vibration risk, which is a well-known cause of work-related pathologies, and proposes an original methodology for mapping the risk exposure of the operators to the activities performed. A miniaturized wearable device is employed to collect vibration data, and the signals obtained are segmented in time windows and processed in order to extract the significant features. Finally, a machine learning classifier has been developed to recognize the worker's activity and to evaluate the related exposure to vibration risks. To validate the methodology proposed, an experimental analysis in real operating conditions has been finally carried out by monitoring the activities performed by a team of workers during harvesting operations. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the methodology proposed.

AB  - Results of bibliometric analysis and a detailed review are reported on the use of supervised machine learning to study hazardous drilling events. The bibliometric analysis attempts to answer pertinent questions related to progress in the use of supervised machine learning for hazardous events due to drilling fluid density/mud weight. The analysis indicates artificial neural network as the most popular algorithm among researchers. Also, deep learning, random forest and support vector machine have gained momentum in recent use.
A critical review of literature on hazardous events and supervised machine learning algorithms are reported. This review was done to observe how the algorithms were used, their relative successes, limitations, as well as input parameters which aided in detection or estimation by the machine learning algorithms. An introduction to deep learning and a review of literature on the use of deep learning with respect to operations involving drilling parameters is presented. The review on deep learning and drilling parameters covered the following operations: lithology identification, drilling rig state determination, generating logging/other drilling parameters and detecting abnormality in data.
The study highlights need of publicly accessible large database with data from different oilfields for development of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms could be used globally for the enhancement of machine learning for new fields or fields with limited data. The availability of such large database would aid researchers in improving or customizing deep learning algorithms in line with the unique needs of drilling activities.

AB  - Microgrids provide power systems with an effective manner to integrate distributed energy resources, increase power supply reliability, and reduce operational cost. However, intermittent renewable energy resources (RESs) makes it challenging to operate a microgrid safely and economically based on forecasting. To overcome this issue, we develop an online energy management approach for efficient microgrid operation using safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL). By considering uncertainties and AC power flow, the proposed method formulates online microgrid energy management as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). The objective is to find a safety-guaranteed scheduling policy to minimize the total operational cost. To achieve this, we use a SDRL method to learn a neural network-based policy based on constrained policy optimization (CPO). Different from tradition DRL methods that allow an agent to freely explore any behavior during training, the proposed method limits the exploration to safe policies that satisfy AC power flow constraints during training. The proposed method is model-free and does not require predictive information or explicit model of the microgrid. The proposed method is trained and tested on a medium voltage distribution network with real-world power grid data from California Independent Operator (CAISO). Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of proposed method over traditional DRL approaches.

TI  - Predicting High-Risk Gambling Based on the First Seven Days of Gambling Activity After Registration Using Account-Based Tracking Data
AU  - Auer, M
AU  - Griffiths, MD
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION
AB  - In recent years, several European regulators have introduced mandatory player tracking to identify potentially problematic online gambling. The present study's aim was to investigate the possibility of predicting future high-risk gambling based on a short time window (i.e., the first seven days after the registration for an online gambling site). The authors were given access to a secondary dataset comprising 37,986 gamblers who registered at a European online gambling operator between January 1 and April 30, 2022. The study examined the association between gambling behavior during the first week after registration and high-risk gambling during the first 90 days after registration. A logistic regression model with high-risk gamblers (based on the first three months of gambling data after initial registration) as the dependent variable and age, gender, and the first week's gambling behavior as independent variables explained 40% of the variance. Age, gender, and seven player tracking features from the first week after registration were significant. Machine learning models confirmed the high correlation between the first week of gambling and a high-risk classification during the first three months after registration. The most important features reported by a Random Forest and a Gradient Boost Machine model were the total amount of money deposited, the number of deposits, the amount of money lost, and the average number of deposits per session. The study showed that high-risk gambling during the first three months of a player's lifetime can be predicted very early after registration. These findings suggest that gambling operators should initiate preventive measures (such as limit setting, mandatory play-breaks, personalized messaging) and monitor gambling behavior at a very early stage after a gambler's initial registration.

AB  - The adoption of AI systems has been widely used across multiple industry domains at an alerting rate without focusing on its ethical concerns. In order to address those concerns, an increasing number of AI ethics frameworks have been suggested recently, which focus on the algorithmic level rather than the systems level. Nonetheless, some system-level approaches mostly cover a single-level governance pattern of the system components in the entire software design life cycle. However, the need to go beyond the singlelevel system design AI ethics frameworks to allow not only a better responsible-AI-by-design but also a trustworthy process pattern that abstracts and links the underlying layers of responsible AI on every level. This paper illustrates a principal-to-practice guide of the multi-level governance within organizations across the globe for AI ethics frameworks. We outline the main gap areas in organizations for AI ethics frameworks. Consecutively, we propose a multi-level governance pattern for responsible AI systems within organizations which is participatory, iterative, flexible and operable that targets those main gap areas. Finally, to assist practitioners in applying the multi-level governance AI in organizations and its impact on the industry level, we will translate it into effective and responsible AI practices using a case study.

AB  - In modern machine learning, we observe the phenomenon of opaqueness debt, which manifests itself by an increased risk of discrimination, lack of reproducibility, and deflated performance due to data drift. An increasing amount of available data and computing power results in the growing complexity of black-box predictive models. To manage these issues, good MLOps practice asks for better validation of model performance and fairness, higher explainability, and continuous monitoring. The necessity for deeper model transparency comes from both scientific and social domains and is also caused by emerging laws and regulations on artificial intelligence. To facilitate the responsible development of machine learning models, we introduce dalex, a Python package which implements a model-agnostic interface for interactive explainability and fairness. It adopts the design crafted through the development of various tools for explainable machine learning; thus, it aims at the unification of existing solutions. This library's source code and documentation are available under open license at https://python.drwhy.ai.

T2  - ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
AB  - With the emergence of Industry 5.0, the human-centric manufacturing paradigm requires manufacturing equipment (robots, etc.) interactively assist human workers to deal with dynamic and complex production tasks. To achieve symbiotic human-robot interaction (HRI), the safety issue serves as a prerequisite foundation. Regarding the growing individualized demand of manufacturing tasks, the conventional rule-based safe HRI measures could not well address the safety requirements due to inflexibility and lacking synergy. To fill the gap, this work proposes a mutual-cognitive safe HRI approach including worker visual augmentation, robot velocity control, Digital Twin-enabled motion preview and collision detection, and Deep Reinforcement Learning-based robot collision avoidance motion planning in the Augmented Reality-assisted manner. Finally, the feasibility of the system design and the performance of the proposed approach are validated by establishing and executing the prototype HRI system in a practical scene.

AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used for robot autonomy because it can adapt to dynamic or unknown environments by automatically learning optimal control policies from the interactions between robots and environments. However, the practical deployment of RL can endanger the safety of both robots and environments because many RL methods must experience failures during the training phase. These failures can be reduced or avoided by assuming knowing prior knowledge about the states and environments in the training phase, but this assumption is easily invalid in practical applications, especially with unknown environments. In addition, restarting a training episode could be difficult in practice because the robot may be stuck in the failures. To solve these problems, we propose an operational safe control framework that can automatically recover from failures and reduce failure risks without any prior knowledge. Our framework consists of three steps: (1) detect failures and revert to safe actions, (2) collect correction samples to learn a potential that provides internal environment information to robots, (3) use the potential to shape a safe reward that biases safe explorations. A maze navigation example is used to demonstrate that our method outperforms the traditional reinforcement learning with significantly less failures.

AB  - Accurate and timely assessment of drilling system is key for achieving safety and efficiency in deep drilling. In this paper, an online assessment model is proposed by applying online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM). The model has been tested through the actual drilling data for drilling system safety assessment and accidents early warning. By analyzing the mechanism characteristics of accidents, well logging parameters are chosen as the input and accident types are chosen as the output. Owing to the OS-ELM is capable of updating network parameters based on new arriving data without retraining historical data, the model can be updated online for specific formation accidents information to make it more adaptable to a particular environment. The numerical test results show that, comparing with other widely used assessment techniques like support vector machines (SVM) and back propagation (BP), the proposed model has a higher accuracy and shorter recognition time.

T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - In recent years, due to the increased availability of data and improvements in computing power, application of machine learning techniques to various aviation safety problems for identifying, isolating, and reducing risk has gained momentum. Data collected from on-board recorders in commercial aircraft contain thousands of parameters in the form of multivariate time-series (continuous, discrete, categorical, etc.) which are used to train the machine learning models. Among the phases of flight, approach and landing phases result in the most accidents and incidents. The performance and trajectory of the aircraft during the approach phase is an indicator of its landing performance which, in turn, affects incident or accident probability such as runway excursions. Landing performance is commonly measured using metrics such as landing airspeed, vertical speed, location of touchdown point on runway, etc. While current applications of machine learning to aviation focus on retrospective insights to implement corrective measures, they offer limited value for real-time risk identification or decision-making as they are inherently reactive in nature. In this work, a novel offline-online framework is developed for building a global predictive model offline to predict landing performance metrics online. The framework leverages flight data from the approach phase between certain approach altitudes (also called gates) in order to train the offline model to predict the landing true airspeed and ground speed using a Random Forest regression algorithm. Permutation importance is used to identify and retain important features among those available and the training data is balanced with respect to flight safety events to ensure a good performing model. The developed global model is robust and can predict landing true airspeed and ground speed with root mean square errors of 2.62 and 2.98 knots respectively over six different airframes operating at over seventy airports. The model operates fast in prediction mode which, coupled with the ability to provide the prediction at an altitude where a go-around decision may be made, makes it particularly suitable for online application. The framework is demonstrated using data obtained from commercial airline operations that contains thousands of flight records and performs better than existing techniques in literature at predicting true airspeed and ground speed at touchdown.

AB  - For an Artificially Intelligent (AI) system to maintain alignment between human desires and its behaviour, it is important that the AI account for human preferences. This paper proposes and empirically evaluates the first approach to aligning agent behaviour to human preference via an apologetic framework. In practice, an apology may consist of an acknowledgement, an explanation and an intention for the improvement of future behaviour. We propose that such an apology, provided in response to recognition of undesirable behaviour, is one way in which an AI agent may both be transparent and trustworthy to a human user. Furthermore, that behavioural adaptation as part of apology is a viable approach to correct against undesirable behaviours. The Act-Assess-Apologise framework potentially could address both the practical and social needs of a human user, to recognise and make reparations against prior undesirable behaviour and adjust for the future. Applied to a dual-auxiliary impact minimisation problem, the apologetic agent had a near perfect determination and apology provision accuracy in several non-trivial configurations. The agent subsequently demonstrated behaviour alignment with success that included up to complete avoidance of the impacts described by these objectives in some scenarios.

AB  - Continuous monitoring and diagnosis are important for safe operation of nuclear facilities. In an emergency shutdown, the diagnostic tasks can be challenging for human operators who may be under intense stress and/or lack training. In recent years, studies using artificial-intelligence technologies have been actively conducted to help in diagnostic tasks. The current study proposes a data-driven approach that leverages deep reinforcement-learning techniques to intelligently learn effective strategies for state diagnosis of safety functions. First, a learning framework and key elements of reinforcement learning are designed as basic components. Then, a deep neural-network structure and a deep reinforcement algorithm are presented for diagnosis learning. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of deep reinforcement learning on diagnosing the safety functions of a nuclear facility.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA, also known as lncRNA, is a series of single-stranded polynucleotides (no less than 200 nucleotides each), consisting of non-protein coding transcripts. LncRNA plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, during the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic processes. This is achieved by lncRNA interacts with the corresponding RNA-binding proteins. It has been drawn to a lot of attention that the reduction of the excessive laboratory cost and the increase in speed and accuracy gains benefits from the employment of computational intelligence in lncRNA-protein interaction (LPI) identification. Although numerous pertinent in silico studies of LPI prediction have been proposed, there is still room for enhancing the accuracy of the existing LPI prediction methods. In this paper, we have proposed a novel method for identifying LPI with kernel target alignment based on semi-supervised link prediction (LPI-KTASLP), which adopts multivariate information to predict lncRNAs-proteins interactions. To integrate the heterogeneous kernels, kernel target alignment has been applied to deal with kernel fusion. We have calculated the low-rank approximation matrices of lncRNA and protein, where eigendecomposition is used to reduce computing pressure. The prediction model has been obtained by producing the ultimate LPI prediction matrix. Experimental results show that the prediction ability of the LPI-KTASLP algorithm has surpassed many other LPI prediction schemes. Our method of lncRNA-protein interaction prediction has been evaluated on a standard benchmark dataset of LPIs. We have observed that the highest AUPR of 0.6148 is obtained by our proposed model (LPI-KTASLP). This is superior to the integrated LPLNP (AUPR: 0.4584), the RWR (AUPR: 0.2827), the CF (AUPR: 0.2357), the LPIHN (AUPR: 0.2299), and the LPBNI (AUPR: 0.3302). It is very encouraging that most of the LPI predictions have been confirmed to be close to relevant concentrations.

AB  - Background: Few studies have systematically investigated robust controllers for lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons (LLREs) that can safely and effectively assist users with a variety of neuromuscular disorders to walk with full autonomy. One of the key challenges for developing such a robust controller is to handle different degrees of uncertain human-exoskeleton interaction forces from the patients. Consequently, conventional walking controllers either are patient-condition specific or involve tuning of many control parameters, which could behave unreliably and even fail to maintain balance. Methods: We present a novel, deep neural network, reinforcement learning-based robust controller for a LLRE based on a decoupled offline human-exoskeleton simulation training with three independent networks, which aims to provide reliable walking assistance against various and uncertain human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The exoskeleton controller is driven by a neural network control policy that acts on a stream of the LLRE’s proprioceptive signals, including joint kinematic states, and subsequently predicts real-time position control targets for the actuated joints. To handle uncertain human interaction forces, the control policy is trained intentionally with an integrated human musculoskeletal model and realistic human-exoskeleton interaction forces. Two other neural networks are connected with the control policy network to predict the interaction forces and muscle coordination. To further increase the robustness of the control policy to different human conditions, we employ domain randomization during training that includes not only randomization of exoskeleton dynamics properties but, more importantly, randomization of human muscle strength to simulate the variability of the patient’s disability. Through this decoupled deep reinforcement learning framework, the trained controller of LLREs is able to provide reliable walking assistance to patients with different degrees of neuromuscular disorders without any control parameter tuning. Results and conclusion: A universal, RL-based walking controller is trained and virtually tested on a LLRE system to verify its effectiveness and robustness in assisting users with different disabilities such as passive muscles (quadriplegic), muscle weakness, or hemiplegic conditions without any control parameter tuning. Analysis of the RMSE for joint tracking, CoP-based stability, and gait symmetry shows the effectiveness of the controller. An ablation study also demonstrates the strong robustness of the control policy under large exoskeleton dynamic property ranges and various human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The decoupled network structure allows us to isolate the LLRE control policy network for testing and sim-to-real transfer since it uses only proprioception information of the LLRE (joint sensory state) as the input. Furthermore, the controller is shown to be able to handle different patient conditions without the need for patient-specific control parameter tuning. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Concrete-filled double skin steel tubular (CFDST) column is a hollow composite structure component, which shows better performance than traditional reinforced concrete and steel columns due to the favorable composite action between steel and concrete. In the current study, a machine learning based interaction model combine with the extended Rankine method is developed to predict fire resistance of eccentrically loaded CFDST cylinder columns. The prediction of the reliable shear bond parameter was conducted by back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree (XGBoost). To perform a reliable production, the architecture and the parametric setting of both models were constructed. Furthermore, the results of the prediction were verified by experimental results and finite element analysis.

TI  - A reinforcement learning-based approach for online optimal control of self-adaptive real-time systems
AU  - Haouari, B.
AU  - Mzid, R.
AU  - Mosbahi, O.
T2  - Neural Computing and Applications
AB  - This paper deals with self-adaptive real-time embedded systems (RTES). A self-adaptive system can operate in different modes. Each mode encodes a set of real-time tasks. To be executed, each task is allocated to a processor (placement) and assigned a priority (scheduling), while respecting timing constraints. An adaptation scenario allows switching between modes by adding, removing, and updating task parameters that must meet related deadlines after adaptation. For such systems, anticipating all operational modes at design time is usually impossible. Online reinforcement learning is increasingly used in the presence of design-time uncertainty. To tackle this problem, we formalize the placement and scheduling problems in self-adaptive RTES as a Markov decision process and propose related algorithms based on Q-learning. Then, we introduce an approach that integrates the proposed algorithms to assist designers in the development of self-adaptive RTES. At the design level, the RL Placement and the RL Scheduler are proposed to process predictable adaptation scenarios. These modules are designed to generate placement and scheduling models for an application while maximizing system extensibility and ensuring real-time feasibility. At the execution level, the RL Adapter is defined to process online adaptations. Indeed, the goal of the RL Adapter agent is to reject the adaptation scenario when feasibility concerns are raised; otherwise, it generates a new feasible placement and scheduling. We apply and simulate the proposed approach to a healthcare robot case study to show its applicability. Performance evaluations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to related works. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Human-robot cooperation is increasingly demanded in industrial applications. Many tasks require the robot to enhance the capabilities of humans. In this scenario, safety also plays an important role in avoiding any accident involving humans, robots, and the environment. With this aim, the paper proposes a cooperative fuzzy-impedance control with embedded safety rules to assist human operators in heavy industrial applications while manipulating unknown weight parts. The proposed methodology is composed by four main components: (i) an inner Cartesian impedance controller (to achieve the compliant robot behavior), (ii) an outer fuzzy controller (to provide the assistance to the human operator), (iii) embedded safety rules (to limit force/velocity during the human-robot interaction enhancing safety), and (iv) a neural network approach (to optimize the control parameters for the human-robot collaboration on the basis of the target indexes of assistance performance defined for this purpose). The main achieved result refers to the capability of the controller to deal with uncertain payloads while assisting and empowering the human operator, both embedding in the controller safety features at force and velocity levels and minimizing the proposed performance indexes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified with a KUKA iiwa 14 R820 manipulator in an experimental procedure where human subjects evaluate the robot performance in a collaborative lifting task of a 10 kg part.

AB  - An automated Condition Monitoring (CM) and real-time controlling framework is essential for outdoor mobile robots to ensure the robot's health and operational safety. This work presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled CM and vibrotactile haptic-feedback-based real-time control framework suitable for deploying mobile robots in dynamic outdoor environments. It encompasses two sections: developing a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) model for predicting system degradation and terrain flaws threshold classes and a vibrotactile haptic feedback system design enabling a remote operator to control the robot as per predicted class feedback in real-time. As vibration is an indicator of failure, we identified and separated system- and terrain-induced vibration threshold levels suitable for CM of outdoor robots into nine classes, namely Safe, moderately safe system-generated, and moderately safe terrain-induced affected by left, right, and both wheels, as well as severe classes such as unsafe system-generated and unsafe terrain-induced affected by left, right, and both wheels. The vibration-indicated data for each class are modelled based on two sensor data: an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor for the change in linear and angular motion and a current sensor for the change in current consumption at each wheel motor. A wearable novel vibrotactile haptic feedback device architecture is presented with left and right vibration modules configured with unique haptic feedback patterns corresponding to each abnormal vibration threshold class. The proposed haptic-feedback-based CM framework and real-time remote controlling are validated with three field case studies using an in-house-developed outdoor robot, resulting in a threshold class prediction accuracy of 91.1% and an effectiveness that, by minimising the traversal through undesired terrain features, is four times better than the usual practice.

T2  - INTERACTION STUDIES
AB  - Previous experimental findings support the hypothesis that laughter and positive emotions are contagious in face-to-face and mediated communication. To test this hypothesis, we describe four experiments in which participants communicate via a chat tool that artificially adds or removes laughter (e.g. haha or lol), without participants being aware of the manipulation. We found no evidence to support the contagion hypothesis. However, artificially exposing participants to more lols decreased participants' use of hahas but led to more involvement and improved task-performance. Similarly, artificially exposing participants to more hahas decreased use of haha but increased lexical alignment. We conclude that, even though the interventions have effects on coordination, they are incompatible with contagion as a primary explanatory mechanism. Instead, these results point to an interpretation that involves a more sophisticated view of dialogue mechanisms along the lines of Conversational Analysis and similar frameworks and we suggest directions for future research.

TI  - Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales in Human-Robot Interaction
AU  - Elish, MC
T2  - ENGAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - As debates about the policy and ethical implications of AI systems grow, it will be increasingly important to accurately locate who is responsible when agency is distributed in a system and control over an action is mediated through time and space. Analyzing several high-profile accidents involving complex and automated socio-technical systems and the media coverage that surrounded them, I introduce the concept of a moral crumple zone to describe how responsibility for an action may be misattributed to a human actor who had limited control over the behavior of an automated or autonomous system. Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the human in a highly complex and automated system may become simply a component-accidentally or intentionally-that bears the brunt of the moral and legal responsibilities when the overall system malfunctions. While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. The concept is both a challenge to and an opportunity for the design and regulation of human-robot systems. At stake in articulating moral crumple zones is not only the misattribution of responsibility but also the ways in which new forms of consumer and worker harm may develop in new complex, automated, or purported autonomous technologies.

AB  - As machines are becoming more interactive, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, the importance of interactions between humans and AI increases as a new type of communication. However, unlike most studies have examined the influence of AI on individuals, fewer studies about how human-AI interactions will impact society have been conducted. It should be acknowledged that we attribute social roles to AI when assigning social tasks, and there are power dynamics within an interaction between humans and AI because of it. Also, we should ask whether the current society is ready for AI to take responsibility for its actions. Finally, limitations on existing human-machine communication (HMC) studies, an unclear definition of AI as an interlocutor and a lack of theoretical frameworks, were pointed out with suggestions. It is expected that considering a machine's social roles and powers in human-AI interactions will broaden the theoretical realm of HMC.

TI  - AI-Enabled Condition Monitoring Framework for Outdoor Mobile Robots Using 3D LiDAR Sensor
AU  - Pookkuttath, S
AU  - Palanisamy, PA
AU  - Elara, MR
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - An automated condition monitoring (CM) framework is essential for outdoor mobile robots to trigger prompt maintenance and corrective actions based on the level of system deterioration and outdoor uneven terrain feature states. Vibration indicates system failures and terrain abnormalities in mobile robots; hence, five vibration threshold classes for CM in outdoor mobile robots were identified, considering both vibration source system deterioration and uneven terrain. This study proposes a novel CM approach for outdoor mobile robots using a 3D LiDAR, employed here instead of its usual use as a navigation sensor, by developing an algorithm to extract the vibration-indicated data based on the point cloud, assuring low computational costs without losing vibration characteristics. The algorithm computes cuboids for two prominent clusters in every point cloud frame and sets motion points at the corners and centroid of the cuboid. The three-dimensional vector displacement of these points over consecutive point cloud frames, which corresponds to the vibration-affected clusters, are compiled as vibration indication data for each threshold class. A simply structured 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)-based vibration threshold prediction model is proposed for fast, accurate, and real-time application. Finally, a threshold class mapping framework is developed which fuses the predicted threshold classes on the 3D occupancy map of the workspace, generating a 3D CbM map in real time, fostering a Condition-based Maintenance (CbM) strategy. The offline evaluation test results show an average accuracy of vibration threshold classes of 89.6% and consistent accuracy during real-time field case studies of 89%. The test outcomes validate that the proposed 3D-LiDAR-based CM framework is suitable for outdoor mobile robots, assuring the robot's health and operational safety.

TI  - AI-Enabled Condition Monitoring Framework for Indoor Mobile Cleaning Robots

AU  - Elara, MR
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - Autonomous mobile cleaning robots are ubiquitous today and have a vast market need. Current studies are mainly focused on autonomous cleaning performances, and there exists a research gap on monitoring the robot's health and safety. Vibration is a key indicator of system deterioration or external factors causing accelerated degradation or threats. Hence, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automated condition monitoring (CM) framework using two heterogeneous sensor datasets to predict the sources of anomalous vibration in mobile robots with high accuracy. This allows triggering proper maintenance or corrective actions based on the condition of the robot's health or workspace, easing condition-based maintenance (CbM). Anomalous vibration sources are classified as induced by uneven Terrain, Collision with obstacles, loose Assembly, and unbalanced Structure, which causes accelerated system deterioration or potential hazards. Here, an unexplored heterogeneous sensor dataset using inertial measurement unit (IMU) and current sensors is proposed for effective recognition across different vibration classes, resulting in higher-accuracy prediction. A simple-structured 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for training and real-time prediction. A 2D CbM map is generated by fusing the predicted classes in real time on an occupancy grid map of the workspace to monitor the conditions of the robot and workspace remotely. The evaluation test results of the proposed method show that the usage of heterogeneous sensors performs significantly more accurately (98.4%) than previous studies, which used IMU (92.2%) and camera (93.8%) sensors individually. Also, this model is comparatively fast, fit for the environment, and ideal for real-time applications in mobile robots based on field trial validations, enhancing mobile robots' productivity and operational safety.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - While environmental criminology suggests that crime and the urban environment are closely related, some studies suggest a nonlinear relationship. This study analyzed the relationship between crime incidence and the urban environment using urban big data such as points-of-interest (POI), smart civil complaint data, and street image data from Naver Street View in Seoul, Korea. For analysis, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method have been used. The analysis results confirmed a nonlinear relationship comprising inflection points between crime incidence and the urban environment. Also, this study identified the interaction effects of urban environmental variables on crime incidence. Finally, the hierarchical clustering method was used to identify the contributions of various aspects of the urban environments to crime incidence. Then, this study provides policy implications to prevent potential criminal activities and promote public safety for sustainable cities and societies.

T2  - SPEECH COMMUNICATION
AB  - This study tests whether individuals vocally align toward emotionally expressive prosody produced by two types of interlocutors: a human and a voice-activated artificially intelligent (voice-AI) assistant. Participants completed a word shadowing experiment of interjections (e.g., "Awesome") produced in emotionally neutral and expressive prosodies by both a human voice and a voice generated by a voice-AI system (Amazon's Alexa). Results show increases in participants' word duration, mean f0, and f0 variation in response to emotional expressiveness, consistent with increased alignment toward a general 'positive-emotional' speech style. Small differences in emotional alignment by talker category (human vs. voice-AI) parallel the acoustic differences in the model talkers' productions, suggesting that participants are mirroring the acoustics they hear. The similar responses to emotion in both a human and voice-AI talker support accounts of unmediated emotional alignment, as well as computer personification: people apply emotionally-mediated behaviors to both types of interlocutors. While there were small differences in magnitude by participant gender, the overall patterns were similar for women and men, supporting a nuanced picture of emotional vocal alignment.

AB  - In this work, the primary focus is to identify potential technical risks of Artificial Intel-ligence (AI)-driven operations for the safety monitoring of the air traffic from the perspective of speech communication by studying the representative case and evaluating user experience. The case study is performed to evaluate the AI-driven techniques and applications using objective metrics, in which several risks and technical facts are obtained to direct future research. Considering the safety-critical specificities of the air traffic control system, a comprehensive subjective evaluation is conducted to collect user experience by a well-designed anonymous questionnaire and a face-to-face interview. In this procedure, the potential risks obtained from the case study are confirmed, and the impacts on human working are considered. Both the case study and the evaluation of user experience provide compatible results and conclusions: (A) the proposed solution is promising to improve the traffic safety and reduce the workload by detecting potential risks in advance; (B) the AI-driven techniques and whole diagram are suggested to be enhanced to eliminate the possible distraction to the attention of air traffic controllers. Finally, a variety of strategies and approaches are discussed to explore their capability to advance the proposed solution to industrial practices.(c) 2022 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB  - Background: Shift work sleep disorders (SWSDs) are associated with the high turnover rates of nurses, and are considered a major medical safety issue. However, initial management can be hampered by insufficient awareness. In recent years, it has become possible to visualize, collect, and analyze the work-life balance of health care workers with irregular sleeping and working habits using wearable sensors that can continuously monitor biometric data under real-life settings. In addition, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychiatric disorders has been shown to be effective. Application of wearable sensors and machine learning may potentially enhance the beneficial effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy.
Objective: In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate the effect of a new internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for SWSD (iCBTS). This system includes current methods such as medical sleep advice, as well as machine learning well-being prediction to improve the sleep durations of shift workers and prevent declines in their well-being.
Methods: This study consists of two phases: (1) preliminary data collection and machine learning for well-being prediction; (2) intervention and evaluation of iCBTS for SWSD. Shift workers in the intensive care unit at Mie University Hospital will wear a wearable sensor that collects biometric data and answer daily questionnaires regarding their well-being. They will subsequently be provided with an iCBTS app for 4 weeks. Sleep and well-being measurements between baseline and the intervention period will be compared.
Results: Recruitment for phase 1 ended in October 2019. Recruitment for phase 2 has started in October 2020. Preliminary results are expected to be available by summer 2021.
Conclusions: iCBTS empowered with well-being prediction is expected to improve the sleep durations of shift workers, thereby enhancing their overall well-being. Findings of this study will reveal the potential of this system for improving sleep disorders among shift workers.

AB  - The utilisation of Deep Learning (DL) raises new challenges regarding its dependability in critical applications. Sound verification and validation methods are needed to assure the safe and reliable use of DL. However, state-of-the-art debug testing methods on DL that aim at detecting adversarial examples (AEs) ignore the operational profile, which statistically depicts the software's future operational use. This may lead to very modest effectiveness on improving the software's delivered reliability, as the testing budget is likely to be wasted on detecting AEs that are unrealistic or encountered very rarely in real-life operation. In this paper, we first present the novel notion of "operational AEs" which are AEs that have relatively high chance to be seen in future operation. Then an initial design of a new DL testing method to efficiently detect "operational AEs" is provided, as well as some insights on our prospective research plan.

TI  - Multi-objective robust optimization for enhanced safety in large-diameter tunnel construction with interactive and explainable AI
AU  - Lin, PH

T2  - RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
AB  - Robust optimization is an ideal solution for enhancing safety in tunnel construction in the presence of unpredictable soil conditions, especially in large-diameter tunnel construction, since it requires the least amount of information about uncertainties. However, the application of robust optimization to real-world projects is greatly hampered by its dependence on mathematical models. To address this issue, this study builds a pipeline machine learning model to forecast tunnel-induced damage that can be addressed using the robust optimization (RO) algorithm with high accuracy. The optimization process is integrated into a building information modeling (BIM) platform and analyzed using the Shapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) technique, allowing the designer to understand and interact with the algorithm. The average improvement of testing samples using an ellipsoidal uncertainty set with a size of 0.05 is 23.8 and 4.9% on the two selected criteria, which is more conservative than using deterministic optimization (DO) and stochastic optimization (SO). This study establishes an interactive and explainable optimization platform that enables designers to make judgments under the most unfavorable soil conditions with the least amount of accessible information about the uncertainties during tunneling.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to create an ideal machine learning model to predict mechanical complications in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery based on GAPB (modified global alignment and proportion scoring with body mass index and bone mineral density) factors.
Methods: Between January 2009 and December 2018, 238 consecutive patients with ASD, who received at least 4-level fusions and were followed-up for 2 years, were included in the study. The data were stratified into training (n = 167, 70%) and test (n = 71, 30%) sets and input to machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest gradient boosting system, and deep neural network.
Results: Body mass index, bone mineral density, the relative pelvic version score, the relative lumbar lordosis score, and the relative sagittal alignment score of the global alignment and proportion score were significantly different in the training and test sets (p < 0.05) between the complication and no complication groups. In the training set, the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) for logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep neural network were 0.871 (0.8170.925), 0.942 (0.9110.974), 1.000 (1.0001.000), and 0.947 (0.9150.980), respectively, and the accuracies were 0.784 (0.7220.847), 0.868 (0.8170.920), 1.000 (1.0001.000), and 0.856 (0.8030.909), re-spectively. In the test set, the AUROCs were 0.785 (0.6780.893), 0.808 (0.7020.914), 0.810 (0.7100.910), and 0.730 (0.6100.850), respectively, and the accuracies were 0.732 (0.6290.835), 0.718 (0.6140.823), 0.732 (0.6290.835), and 0.620 (0.5070.733), respectively. The random forest achieved the best predictive performance on the training and test dataset.
Conclusion: This study created a comprehensive model to predict mechanical complications after ASD surgery. The best prediction accuracy was 73.2% for predicting mechanical complications after ASD surgery. This information can be used to prevent mechanical complications during ASD surgery.

TI  - Long-term carbon dioxide experiments with salmonids
AU  - Fivelstad, S
T2  - AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Oxygen is generally the first limiting factor for the water flow requirement in a land based aquaculture system, while carbon dioxide and pH are secondary limiting factors. This means that if oxygen is added to the inlet water or directly to the water in a fish tank carbon dioxide becomes the limiting factor. pH is easy to regulate by addition of bicarbonate, while carbon dioxide always will be elevated in both single pass oxygenated systems and in recirculation systems. Carbon dioxide has both direct physiological effects on the fish, as well as indirect effects by changing the pH and thereby the chemistry of metals in the water. During the last 20 years several long-term carbon dioxide experiments have been performed at Bergen University College. In the present paper general methods and findings from the research at Bergen University College are described. These findings are compared with studies performed elsewhere. Increased plasma PCO2 increases the plasma bicarbonate concentration and reduces the plasma chloride concentration. In a long-term carbon dioxide experiment on Atlantic salmon postsmolts about 94% of the total variation in plasma carbon dioxide partial pressure was explained by the partial pressure in the water in a simple linear regression model, and 72% of the total variation in plasma chloride was explained by the plasma bicarbonate concentration. There was a reduction in about 1 mM Cl- for every 1 mM increase in plasma bicarbonate.
For carbon dioxide the safe criterion used for the Norwegian production of Atlantic salmon smolts is 15 mg L-1. In low alkalinity fresh water carbon dioxide has adverse effects on fish in combination with labile Al/pH at concentrations around 8-10 mg L-1 CO2, and the smolts are not acclimated to such conditions. When toxic AI is not present in the water 8-10 mg L-1 carbon dioxide may have slight but significant effects on condition factor during the first month, but the smolts seem to be acclimated to these conditions after 2 months. However, when the concentration of carbon dioxide is 17-19 mg L-1 (5-6 mm Hg) in low alkalinity water, condition factor or specific growth rate is reduced after 2 months exposure.
In high alkalinity fresh water, carbon dioxide had only minor effects on growth up to 24 mg L-1, however, further research may be needed to validate this and to study how the safe threshold level for carbon dioxide is influenced by temperature and salinity.

AB  - "Psychiatric Treatment Adverse Reactions" (PsyTAR) corpus is an annotated corpus that has been developed using patients narrative data for psychiatric medications, particularly SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and SNRIs (Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) medications. This corpus consists of three main components: sentence classification, entity identification, and entity normalization. We split the review posts into sentences and labeled them for presence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (2168 sentences), withdrawal symptoms (WDs) (438 sentences), sign/symptoms/illness (SSIs) (789 sentences), drug indications (517), drug effectiveness (EF) (1087 sentences), and drug infectiveness (INF) (337 sentences). In the entity identification phase, we identified and extracted ADRs (4813 mentions), WDs (590 mentions), SSIs (1219 mentions), and DIs (792). In the entity normalization phase, we mapped the identified entities to the corresponding concepts in both UMLS (918 unique concepts) and SNOMED CT (755 unique concepts). Four annotators double coded the sentences and the span of identified entities by strictly following guidelines rules developed for this study. We used the PsyTAR sentence classification component to automatically train a range of supervised machine learning classifiers to identifying text segments with the mentions of ADRs, WDs, DIs, SSIs, EF, and INF. SVMs classifiers had the highest performance with F-Score 0.90. We also measured performance of the cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) in identifying patients' expressions of ADRs and WDs with and without adding PsyTAR dictionary to the core dictionary of cTAKES. Augmenting cTAKES dictionary with PsyTAR improved the F-score cTAKES by 25%. The findings imply that PsyTAR has significant implications for text mining algorithms aimed to identify information about adverse drug events and drug effectiveness from patients' narratives data, by linking the patients' expressions of adverse drug events to medical standard vocabularies. The corpus is publicly available at Zolnoori et al. [30].

AB  - Pedestrian detection is one of hot topics in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition, which is of great value to video surveillance, intelligent traffic and human-computer interaction, etc. and how to improve detection rate and speed is the key. Most traditional pedestrian detection methods are based on the pyramid sliding window scanning method, and for images in which the majority of the region does not contain a body, the detection is inefficient. This study presents a body window sampling algorithm based on binarised normed gradients, which can quickly and effectively extract the window of the image that most likely contains human body to be identified, thus greatly improving the detection speed and obtaining a lower false alarm rate. The authors employ the histogram of oriented gradient feature and the linear support vector machine to train the classifier. For the same false test case in comparison with the pyramid scanning method, when the authors used 2,000 sampling windows for detection, they observed a detection rate increase of 11%, the detection speed increased 19.6 times. For 5,000 sampling windows, the detection rate increased by 20% and the detection speed increased 7.8 times.

T2  - DRUG HEALTHCARE AND PATIENT SAFETY
AB  - Background: AI platforms are equipped with advanced algorithms that have the potential to offer a wide range of applications in healthcare services. However, information about the accuracy of AI chatbots against conventional drug-drug interaction tools is limited. This study aimed to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bing AI, and Bard in predicting drug-drug interactions.Methods: AI-based chatbots (ie, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Bing AI, and Google Bard) were compared for their abilities to detect clinically relevant DDIs for 255 drug pairs. Descriptive statistics, such as specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV), were calculated for each tool.Results: When a subscription tool was used as a reference, the specificity ranged from a low of 0.372 (ChatGPT-3.5) to a high of 0.769 (Microsoft Bing AI). Also, Microsoft Bing AI had the highest performance with an accuracy score of 0.788, with ChatGPT-3.5 having the lowest accuracy rate of 0.469. There was an overall improvement in performance for all the programs when the reference tool switched to a free DDI source, but still, ChatGPT-3.5 had the lowest specificity (0.392) and accuracy (0.525), and Microsoft Bing AI demonstrated the highest specificity (0.892) and accuracy (0.890). When assessing the consistency of accuracy across two different drug classes, ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 showed the highest variability in accuracy. In addition, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard exhibited the highest fluctuations in specificity when analyzing two medications belonging to the same drug class.Conclusion: Bing AI had the highest accuracy and specificity, outperforming Google's Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, and ChatGPT-4. The findings highlight the significant potential these AI tools hold in transforming patient care. While the current AI platforms evaluated are not without limitations, their ability to quickly analyze potentially significant interactions with good sensitivity suggests a promising step towards improved patient safety.

AU  - Zellou, G

T2  - FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION
AB  - Speech alignment is where talkers subconsciously adopt the speech and language patterns of their interlocutor. Nowadays, people of all ages are speaking with voice-activated, artificially-intelligent (voice-AI) digital assistants through phones or smart speakers. This study examines participants' age (older adults, 53-81 years old vs. younger adults, 18-39 years old) and gender (female and male) on degree of speech alignment during shadowing of (female and male) human and voice-AI (Apple's Siri) productions. Degree of alignment was assessed holistically via a perceptual ratings AXB task by a separate group of listeners. Results reveal that older and younger adults display distinct patterns of alignment based on humanness and gender of the human model talkers: older adults displayed greater alignment toward the female human and device voices, while younger adults aligned to a greater extent toward the male human voice. Additionally, there were other gender-mediated differences observed, all of which interacted with model talker category (voice-AI vs. human) or shadower age category (OA vs. YA). Taken together, these results suggest a complex interplay of social dynamics in alignment, which can inform models of speech production both in human-human and human-device interaction.

AB  - The present study deals with human awareness, which is a very important aspect of human-robot interaction. This feature is particularly essential in agricultural environments, owing to the information-rich setup that they provide. The objective of this investigation was to recognize human activities associated with an envisioned synergistic task. In order to attain this goal, a data collection field experiment was designed that derived data from twenty healthy participants using five wearable sensors (embedded with tri-axial accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers) attached to them. The above task involved several sub-activities, which were carried out by agricultural workers in real field conditions, concerning load lifting and carrying. Subsequently, the obtained signals from on-body sensors were processed for noise-removal purposes and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory neural network, which is widely used in deep learning for feature recognition in time-dependent data sequences. The proposed methodology demonstrated considerable efficacy in predicting the defined sub-activities with an average accuracy of 85.6%. Moreover, the trained model properly classified the defined sub-activities in a range of 74.1-90.4% for precision and 71.0-96.9% for recall. It can be inferred that the combination of all sensors can achieve the highest accuracy in human activity recognition, as concluded from a comparative analysis for each sensor's impact on the model's performance. These results confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology for human awareness purposes in agricultural environments, while the dataset was made publicly available for future research.

AB  - Commercial grain elevators are hazardous agro-manufacturing work environments where workers are prone to serious and life-threatening injuries. The aim of this study is to give insight into safety risks in grain handling facilities through information processing of workers' compensation data on agro-manufacturing occupational incidents within commercial grain elevators in the Midwest region of the United States between 2008 and 2016. The severity of occupational incidents is determined by total dollar amount incurred on medical, indemnity, and other expenses in workers' compensation claims. The most important factors that affect the cost escalation of occupational incidents are extracted using bootstrap partitioning method, and are applied as input for constructing two machine learning models: random forests decision trees, and na ve Bayes. Both models show high accuracy (87.64% and 92.78% respectively) in predicting that a future claim is classified as either low or medium, severity. The models contribute to identifying high injury risk groups, and prevalent incident causes, allowing a more research -based focused intervention effort in grain handling workplaces. In addition, the results are applicable in forecasting cost severity of future claims, and identifying factors that contribute to the escalation of claims costs. (c) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This paper proposes a road surface recognition system based on a "laser radar" (LIDER), which is used to detect a lane markings for application to an automatic platooning system for trucks. To ensure the safety of automatic driving, there is a need to recognize the road surface conditions (dry, wet, etc.). This system proposes an integrated system that is not only capable of recognizing lane markings but also monitors the road surface using a laser radar scanning system. Our road surface recognition method relies on the multiple reflection intensities of laser radar and a machine learning algorithm. By using multiple reflection intensities, the recognition rate is improved. Moreover, to improve the recognition rate, an additional feature variable, called the "roughness index," is proposed. In this paper, the concept of a road surface recognition system is proposed and six road surface conditions (dry old asphalt, moist old asphalt, flooded old asphalt, dry new asphalt, moist new asphalt, and flooded new asphalt) are recognized by the proposed algorithm. The quality of the road surface recognition is examined through comparison with long-term measurement data. The proposed method exhibits a high level of road surface recognition performance.

AB  - Two studies investigated the influence of conversational role on phonetic imitation toward human and voice-AI interlocutors. In a Word List Task, the giver instructed the receiver on which of two lists to place a word; this dialogue task is similar to simple spoken interactions users have with voice-AI systems. In a Map Task, participants completed a fill-in-the-blank worksheet with the interlocutors, a more complex interactive task. Participants completed the task twice with both interlocutors, once as giver-of-information and once as receiver-of-information. Phonetic alignment was assessed through similarity rating, analysed using mixed effects logistic regressions. In the Word List Task, participants aligned to a greater extent toward the human interlocutor only. In the Map Task, participants as giver only aligned more toward the human interlocutor. Results indicate that phonetic alignment is mediated by the type of interlocutor and that the influence of conversational role varies across tasks and interlocutors.

AU  - Menor-Flores, M

T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - The number of investigations attempting to align protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has increased with the growth of studies focused on collecting PPI data. These works aim to identify conserved areas between species that are difficult to differentiate due to speciation. However, there is no standard approach to align PPI networks, and global aligners encounter difficulties in constructing alignments with high biological and structural quality. To address this issue, we propose an innovative ensemble technique that combines the strengths of aligners in the PPI network alignment field while avoiding their weaknesses. This approach reduces the spread of dispersion in so different individual global aligners and contributes to achieving a global standard that produces alignments of higher quality. This is possible thanks to the two branches composing our ensemble that aim to improve alignments in terms of biological or structural quality. In addition to a new heuristic replacing the second-level aligner in the biological quality-focused branch. Our approach achieves alignments of higher quality, as demonstrated through experiments with 10 different scenarios involving real data from 5 species. Our solutions outperform other individual aligners and ensemble techniques, like bagging, in terms of biological and structural quality. Moreover, the time required to perform the ensemble is minimal compared to that of individual aligners.

AB  - Incipient fault detection and diagnosis for centrifugal chillers is significant for maintaining safe and effective system operation. Due to the advantages of simple learning algorithm and high generalization capability, the extreme learning machine (ELM) can identify faults quickly and precisely in comparison to conventional classification methods such as back propagation neural network (BPNN). This paper reports an effective diagnosis method for incipient chiller faults with the integration of kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) and voting based ELM (VELM). KECA was first performed to reduce the dimensionality of the original input data so as to minimize the model complexity and computational cost. Instead of using a single ELM, multiple independent ELMs were adopted in VELM, and then the class label could be predicted based on the majority voting method. Using the experimental data of seven typical faults together with a normal operation, the proposed KECA-VELM fault diagnostic model was trained and further validated. The results show that a better fault diagnosis performance can be achieved using the KECA-VELM classifier compared with the conventional BPNN, ELM and VELM based classifiers. The overall average fault diagnosis accuracy for the faults at the least severity level was reported over 95% based on the proposed method.

AB  - With the integration of computation, networking, and physical process components to seamlessly combine hardware and software resources to improve process efficiency, cybersecurity has become increasingly important for reliable process control, process operation, and supply chain management in the chemical process industries. This paper provides an overview of recent works on cybersecurity issues in the area of process control, process operation and supply chain. We start with an overview of recent cyber-attack detection and mitigation works via machine learning (ML) and model predictive control (MPC) to detect and handle intelligent cyber-attacks. Several most common intelligent cyber-attacks in industrial control systems are first presented, followed by machine learning detection methods and resilient control strategies with encryption- decryption tools to achieve secure communication in the sensor-controller and controller-actuator links. Novel control architectures with inherent robustness to prevent cyber-attacks are then presented. We continue with an overview of cybersecurity issues in process operations and supply chains as well as the interface between information technology and operational technology. Finally, we discuss recent efforts on the interface of cybersecurity and process safety and conclude with a discussion of open issues in this emerging research field.

AB  - Soft robotic modules have potential use for therapeutic and educational purposes. To do so, they need to be safe, soft, smart, and customizable to serve individuals' different preferences and personalities. A safe modular robotic product made of soft materials, particularly silicon, programmed by artificial intelligence algorithms and developed via additive manufacturing would be promising. This study focuses on the safe tactile interaction between humans and robots by means of soft material characteristics for translating physical communication to auditory. The embedded vibratory sensors used to stimulate touch senses transmitted through soft materials are presented. The soft module was developed and verified successfully to react to three different patterns of human-robot contact, particularly users' touches, and then communicate the type of contact with sound. The study develops and verifies a model that can classify different tactile gestures via machine learning algorithms for safe human-robot physical interaction. The system accurately recognizes the gestures and shapes of three-dimensional (3D) printed soft modules. The gestures used for the experiment are the three most common, including slapping, squeezing, and tickling. The model builds on the concept of how safe human-robot physical interactions could help with cognitive and behavioral communication. In this context, the ability to measure, classify, and reflect the behavior of soft materials in robotic modules represents a prerequisite for endowing robotic materials in additive manufacturing for safe interaction with humans.

AB  - In this study, combustion instability has been diagnosed by performing machine learning using the flame images measured from a model gas turbine combustor. The images were acquired with an ultra-high-speed camera at the rate of 8 kHz in the transition condition of combustion instability from stable to unstable regimes. To judge the onset of combustion instability, two machine learning models of CNN and CNN+LSTM were developed and applied, and their diagnostic performances were evaluated using confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score. It was confirmed that the CNN model performs partially inaccurate classification with an accuracy of 48.92 similar to 100% because it was trained and judges with only a single image, whereas the CNN+LSTM model, which uses time-series flame image data, performs very accurate classification with an accuracy of 98.97 similar to 100%.

AB  - Background: Clinicians' scope of responsibilities is being steadily transformed by digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (DAI solutions). Most tools developed to foster ethical practices lack rigor and do not concurrently capture the health, social, economic, and environmental issues that such solutions raise.
Objective: To support clinical leadership in this field, we aimed to develop a comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool that measures the responsibility of DAI solutions by adapting the multidimensional and already validated Responsible Innovation in Health Tool.
Methods: We conducted a 3-phase mixed methods study. Relying on a scoping review of available tools, phase 1 (concept mapping) led to a preliminary version of the Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool. In phase 2, an international 2-round e-Delphi expert panel rated on a 5-level scale the importance, clarity, and appropriateness of the tool's components. In phase 3, a total of 2 raters independently applied the revised tool to a sample of DAI solutions (n=25), interrater reliability was measured, and final minor changes were made to the tool.
Results: The mapping process identified a comprehensive set of responsibility premises, screening criteria, and assessment attributes specific to DAI solutions. e-Delphi experts critically assessed these new components and provided comments to increase content validity (n=293), and after round 2, consensus was reached on 85% (22/26) of the items surveyed. Interrater agreement was substantial for a subcriterion and almost perfect for all other criteria and assessment attributes.
Conclusions: The Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool offers a comprehensive, valid, and reliable means of assessing the degree of responsibility of DAI solutions in health. As regulation remains limited, this forward-looking tool has the potential to change practice toward more equitable as well as economically and environmentally sustainable digital health care.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS
AB  - Aggression in children is frequent during the early years of childhood. Among children with psychiatric disorders in general, and autism in particular, challenging behaviours and aggression rates are higher. These can take on different forms, such as hitting, kicking, and throwing objects. Social robots that are able to detect undesirable interactions within its surroundings can be used to target such behaviours. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five machine learning techniques in characterizing five possible undesired interactions between a child and a social robot. We examine the effects of adding different combinations of raw data and extracted features acquired from two sensors on the performance and speed of prediction. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the best developed model with children. Machine learning algorithms experiments showed that XGBoost achieved the best performance across all metrics (e.g., accuracy of 90%) and provided fast predictions (i.e., 0.004 s) for the test samples. Experiments with features showed that acceleration data were the most contributing factor on the prediction compared to gyroscope data and that combined data of raw and extracted features provided a better overall performance. Testing the best model with data acquired from children performing interactions with toys produced a promising performance for the shake and throw behaviours. The findings of this work can be used by social robot developers to address undesirable interactions in their robotic designs.

AB  - This paper presents a big data analytics method for the proactive mitigation of grounding risk. The model encompasses the dynamics of ship motion trajectories while accounting for kinematic uncertainties in real operational conditions. The approach combines K-means and DB-SCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) big data clustering methods with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group environmental factors. A Multiple-Output Gaussian Process Regression (MOGPR) method is consequently used to predict selected ship motion dynamics. Ship sway is defined as the deviation between a ship and her motion trajectory centreline. Surge accelerations are used to idealise the time-varying manoeuvring of ships in various routes. Operational conditions are simulated by Automatic Identification System (AIS), General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), and nowcast hydro-meteorological data records. A Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is adopted to identify ship centre-line trajectories along selected paths. The machine learning algorithm is applied for ship motion predictions of Ro-Pax ships operating between two ports in the Gulf of Finland. Ship motion dynamics are visualised along the ship's route using a Gaussian Progress Regression (GPR) flow method. Results indicate that the present methodology may assist with predicting the probabilistic distribution of ship dynamics (speed, sway distance, drift angle, and surge accelerations) and grounding risk along selected ship routes.

AB  - AI-enabled Cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as artificial pancreas (AP) or autonomous cars are using machine learning to make several critical decisions. The system is subject to inputs and scenarios which are not observed during training and the expected outputs are not known. Hence, popular model based verification techniques that characterize behavior of a control system before deployment using predictive models may be inaccurate and often result in incorrect safety analysis results. In addition, regulatory agencies are required to regulate safety-critical AI enabled CPS to ensure their operational safety. However, high complexity of the system result in myriad of safety concerns all of which may not only be comprehensively tested before deployment but also may not even be detected during design and testing phase. In this work, we propose a tool to help regulatory agencies compare the operation of the CPS with the specifications given by the manufacturer to ensure that the operation results conform with the safety assured design of a CPS.

AB  - This paper aims to propose a probabilistic approach to evaluate tunnel safety considering anchoring-grouting effect and arch failure mechanism based on mechanical analysis, machine learning and reliability calculation. Cohesion and internal friction angle of rock mass influenced by grouting, bolt preload and bolt layout are deduced based on Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Test inversion analysis has achieved promising results. Hence, the coupling model of reinforced and unreinforced rock mass is constructed to obtain the ground reaction curve. The support characteristic curve of different kinds of supporting arches are investigated based on numerical simulation which highlights the influence of structural buckling. Thereafter, a case study based on a deep tunnel in loosening rock mass is investigated to study the rock-support interaction and to evaluate engineering reliability. The research results provide insights into the design of tunnel support schemes through the viewpoint of convergence-confinement method and statistical analysis, which provides basis for safety design in tunnel excavation.

AB  - Fibrous scaffolds have been extensively used in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems to establish in vitro models in cell biology, tissue engineering, and drug screening. It is a common practice to characterize cell behaviors on such scaffolds using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As a noninvasive technology, CLSM images can be utilized to describe cell-scaffold interaction under varied morphological features, biomaterial composition, and internal structure. Unfortunately, such information has not been fully translated and delivered to researchers due to the lack of effective cell segmentation methods. We developed herein an end-to-end model called Aligned Disentangled Generative Adversarial Network (AD-GAN) for 3D unsupervised nuclei segmentation of CLSM images. AD-GAN utilizes representation disentanglement to separate content representation (the underlying nuclei spatial structure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure) and align the disentangled content in the latent space. The CLSM images collected from fibrous scaffold-based culturing A549, 3T3, and HeLa cells were utilized for nuclei segmentation study. Compared with existing commercial methods such as Squassh and CellProfiler, our AD-GAN can effectively and efficiently distinguish nuclei with the preserved shape and location information. Building on such information, we can rapidly screen cell-scaffold interaction in terms of adhesion, migration and proliferation, so as to improve scaffold design.

AB  - In safety-critical automatic systems, safety can be compromised if operators lack engagement. Effective detection of undesirable engagement states can inform the design of interventions for enhancing engagement. However, the existing engagement measurement methods suffer from several limitations which damage their effectiveness in the work environment. A novel engagement evaluation methodology, which adopts Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, has been proposed. It was developed using motorway control room operators as subjects. Openpose and Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) were used to estimate the body postures of operators, then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilised to build the engagement evaluation model based on discrete states of operator engagement. The average accuracy of the evaluation results reached 0.89 and the weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score were all above 0.84. This study emphasises the importance of specific data labelling when measuring typical engagement states, forming the basis for potential control room improvements.Practitioner summary: This study demonstrates an automatic, real-time, objective, and relatively unobtrusive method for measuring dynamic operator engagement states. Computer vision technologies were used to estimate body posture, then machine learning (ML) was utilised to build the engagement evaluation model. The overall evaluation shows the effectiveness of this framework.

AB  - In this paper, a framework for a system that will supervise the robot's action and behavior in the human-robot shared workspace is proposed. The function of the robot supervision system is to adaptively control the robot motion based on the human actions in order to optimize the productivity of a task while ensuring human safety. The real-time perception of the human action and environment will be done using a motion capture setup. The inspiration for the framework based on a human behavior model is explained.

T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN
AB  - This work proposes a real-time model predictive control (MPC) system using control Lyapunov-barrier functions (CLBF) and recurrent neural network (RNN) models to ensure simultaneous closed-loop stability and operational safety for a general class of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying disturbances. An RNN model is first developed for the nominal system (i.e., without disturbances) and incorporated in the designs of CLBF-based MPC and of CLEF-based economic MPC (EMPC) to provide state predictions for the optimization problems of MPCs. Subsequently, to improve the closed-loop performance in terms of operational safety and stability in the presence of disturbances, online learning of RNN models is incorporated within the real-time implementation of CLBF-MPC and of CLBF-EMPC to update the RNN models using the most recent process measurement data. The proposed adaptive machine-learning-based CLBF-MPC and CLBF-EMPC schemes are evaluated using a nonlinear chemical process example. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The main protagonist in Kazuo Ishiguro's latest novel is Klara, an artificial friend whose existential goal is to be a child's companion. Some aspects of this fictional narrative have begun to gradually enter our daily lives. Products reminiscent of Klara are available abundantly on the market: smart toys, adaptive learning applications, and companion robots. Children can relate to these products and perform activities together with them. Preliminary research has shown fundamental differences between existing technologies and these emerging children's digital companions. However, we still do not know much about their benefits and risks. This paper explores different and even contradicting perspectives on the phenomenon. We present the discussion from four perspectives -1) temporality, 2) use, 3) trust and ethics, and 4) sociotechnical design -and conclude the paper with an agenda for interdisciplinary IS research. The agenda points to the need for a psychological, medical, engineering, and temporal research community to understand this emerging sociotechnical phenomenon and design its future for the better.

AB  - Trust is essential in designing autonomous and semi-autonomous Robots and Autonomous Systems (RAS), because of the "No trust, no use'' concept. RAS should provide high quality services, with four key properties that make them trustworthy: they must be (i) robust with regards to any system health related issues, (ii) safe for any matters in their surrounding environments, (iii) secure against any threats from cyber spaces, and (iv) trusted for human- machine interaction. This article thoroughly analyses the challenges in implementing the trustworthy RAS in respects of the four properties, and addresses the power of AI in improving the trustworthiness of RAS. While we focus on the benefits that AI brings to human, we should realize the potential risks that could be caused by AI. This article introduces for the first time the set of key aspects of human-centered AI for RAS, which can serve as a cornerstone for implementing trustworthy RAS by design in the future.

AB  - Chemogenomics, also known as proteochemometrics, covers various computational methods for predicting interactions between related drugs and targets on large-scale data. Chemogenomics is used in the early stages of drug discovery to predict the off-target effects of proteins against therapeutic candidates. This study aims to predict unknown ligand-target interactions using one-dimensional SMILES as inputs for ligands and binding site residues for proteins in a computationally efficient manner. We first formulate a Deep learning CNN model using one-dimensional SMILES for drugs and motif-rich binding pocket subsequences of proteins as inputs. We evaluate and compare the proposed deep learning model trained on expert-based features against shallow feature-based machine learning methods. The proposed method achieved better or similar performance on the MSE and AUPR metrics than the shallow methods. Additionally, We show that our deep learning model, DeepPS is computationally more efficient than the deep learning model trained on full-length raw sequences of proteins. We conclude that a beneficial research approach would be to integrate structural information of proteins for modeling drug-target interaction prediction of large datasets for more interpretability, high throughput, and broad applicability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Products and services empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming widespread in today's marketplace. However, consumers have mixed feelings about AI technologies due to the numerous ethical challenges associated the development and deployment of AI. Drawing upon prior research on the moral significance of technology and the emerging literature on AI, we delineate three key dimensions of AI-enabled products (i.e., multi-functionality, interactivity, and AI intelligence stage) that have relevance for ethical implications and adopt a socio-technical approach to provide a multi-layered ethical analysis of AI products at the product-, consumer-, and society-levels. Some key ethical issues identified in the paper include AI biases, ethical design, consumer privacy, cybersecurity, individual autonomy and wellbeing, and unemployment. Companies need to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) to shape the future of ethical AI; drawing upon stakeholder theory and institutional theory, we develop a conceptual framework on AI-related CSR, highlighting the product-, company-, and institutional environment-specific factors that influence firms' socially responsible actions in the domain of AI and discussing the subsequent outcomes for firm, consumers, and the society. We include a section on future research agenda for AI ethics and firm CSR in this important domain.

AB  - Robotic and artificially intelligent (AI) systems are becoming prevalent in our day-to-day lives. As human interaction is increasingly replaced by human-computer and human-robot interaction (HCI and HRI), we occasionally speak and act as though we are blaming or praising various technological devices. While such responses may arise naturally, they are still unusual. Indeed, for some authors, it is the programmers or users-and not the system itself-that we properly hold responsible in these cases. Furthermore, some argue that since directing blame or praise at technology itself is unfitting, designing systems in ways that encourage such practices can only exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, there may be good moral reasons to continue engaging in our natural practices, even in cases involving AI systems or robots. In particular, daily interactions with technology may stand to impact the development of our moral practices in human-to-human interactions. In this paper, we put forward an empirically grounded argument in favor of some technologies being designed for social responsiveness. Although our usual practices will likely undergo adjustments in response to innovative technologies, some systems which we encounter can be designed to accommodate our natural moral responses. In short, fostering HCI and HRI that sustains and promotes our natural moral practices calls for a co-developmental process with some AI and robotic technologies.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING
AB  - In-line inspection (ILI) is a common and useful way to provide comprehensive threat assessments and to detect defect dimensions. However, the ILI is very expensive and most of its costs are unnecessary since very few pipelines contain defects. Many previous studies have used machine learning (ML) methods to predict the safety of pipelines based on the features extracted from ILI signal results, which is very laborious and difficult to apply in industry. In this paper, the ILI results were predicted using multiple ML models through three prediction cases with only pipeline attributes and environmental features as input variables. In the first case, six ML methods were compared to predict whether there are defects in a pipeline section. The Catboost (CAT) method showed the best performance in all evaluation metrics with the highest certain prediction ratio (94%). The second case was using three ML methods to predict a defect depth, defect length, and defect width. The prediction accuracy of the defect depth was much higher than that of the defect length and defect width. A CAT model was the optimal model in this case due to its best performance in all the predictions. In the third prediction case, three ML methods were used to predict a defect length growth rate and defect depth growth rate based on different ILI results from different years. CAT was also the best method in this case with the highest accuracy. The predicted defect length growth rate and defect depth growth rate were used to calculate the remaining lifetime of pipelines based on the maximum allowable defect depth and failure pressure. The remaining lifetime of pipelines with different thickness, land use, and soil types was analyzed with changes in the specified minimum yield strength of a pipeline, a pipeline year, and maximum operating pressure. The accurate predictions in the three cases and the correlation analysis between input features and outputs helped company save a lot of costs and provided valuable information and suggestions in the further progress.

AB  - Understanding Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is of fundamental importance in deciphering cellular processes. Predicting PPls is thus critical in making new discoveries in the biological domains. Traditionally, new PPls are identified through biochemical experiments but such methods are labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming and technically ineffective due to high false positive rates. Computational docking is an alternative but requires the three-dimensional structures of the target proteins which are not always accessible. Sequence-based prediction is the most readily applicable and cost-effective method. It exploits known PPI Databases to construct classifiers for predicting unknown PPls based only on sequence data. However, existing methods, adopting features that fix the pattern length and use exact patterns, are biologically unrealistic. Also, those based on SVM and String Kernel are hardly biologically interpretable since they do not compute the features. Recently, we have developed a new method for predicting PPI known as WeMine-P2P based on our WeMine Aligned Pattern Clustering algorithm which discovers and identifies the localized and co-occurring conserved patterns and regions allowing variable length and pattern variations. As our first attempt, under 40 independent experiments, we showed that (1) WeMine-P2P outperforms the well-known algorithm, PIPE2 which also utilizes co-occurring amino acid sequence segments but does not allow variable lengths and pattern variations; (2) Unlike SVM-based methods, WeMine-P2P renders interpretable biological features; (3) WeMine-P2P achieves satisfactory PPI prediction performance, comparable to the SVM-based methods particularly in unseen protein sequences, with a potential reduction of feature dimension of 1280x. WeMine-P2P is extendable to other biosequence interactions such as predicting Protein-DNA interactions.

AB  - Predicting Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is important for making new discoveries in the molecular mechanisms inside a cell. Traditionally, new PPIs are identified through biochemical experiments but such methods are labor-intensive, expensive, time-consuming and technically ineffective due to high false positive rates. Sequence-based prediction is currently the most readily applicable and cost-effective method. It exploits known PPI Databases to construct classifiers for predicting unknown PPIs based only on sequence data without requiring any other prior knowledge. Among existing sequence based methods, most feature-based methods use exact sequence patterns with fixed length as features a constraint which is biologically unrealistic. SVM with Pairwise String Kernel renders better predicting performance. However it is difficult to be biologically interpretable since it is kernel-based where no concrete feature values are computed. Here we have developed a novel method WeMine-P2P to overcome these drawbacks. By assuming that the regions/sites that mediate PPI are more conserved, WeMine-P2P first discovers/locates the conserved sequence patterns in protein sequences in the form of Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs), allowing pattern variations with variable length. It then pairs up all APCs into a set of Co-Occurring APC (cAPC) pairs, and computes a cAPC-PPI score for each cAPC pair on all PPI pairs. It further constructs a feature vector composed of all cAPC pairs with their cAPC-PPI scores for each PPI pair and uses them for constructing a PPI predictor. Through 40 independent experiments, we showed that (1) WeMine-P2P outperforms the well-known algorithm, PIPE2, which also utilizes co-occurring amino acid sequence segments but does not allow variable lengths and pattern variations; (2) WeMine-P2P achieves satisfactory PPI prediction performance, comparable to the SVM-based methods particularly among unseen protein sequences with a potential reduction of feature dimension of 1280 x; (3) Unlike SVM-based methods, WeMine-P2P renders interpretable biological features from which we observed that co-occurring sequence patterns from the compositional bias regions are more discriminative. WeMine-P2P is extendable to predict other biosequence interactions such as Protein DNA interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does CSR Reduce Idiosyncratic Risk? Roles of Operational Efficiency and AI Innovation
AU  - Li, G
AU  - Li, N

T2  - PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - In the context of Industry 4.0, corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays an increasingly important role in firm risk management. To mitigate risk and improve operational productivity, artificial intelligence (AI), a key disruptive technology, has been increasingly employed in many industries. In this study, we examine the relationship between CSR and idiosyncratic risk (IR) as moderated by AI innovation and operational efficiency based on data from 1614 firms in China during the period from 2010 to 2017. The empirical results show that CSR can negatively affect IR, while beyond a certain level, it acts in the opposite direction, exhibiting a U-shaped relationship. In particular, operational efficiency shifts the turning point of the U-shaped curve to the right, implying that firms with high operational efficiency can obtain a higher optimal benefit by improving their CSR. Furthermore, AI innovation flattens the U-shaped curve, thereby weakening CSR's positive impact on IR. This result indicates that AI innovation is not always beneficial. As AI innovation can have some substitution effect on CSR, enterprises should focus on either CSR or AI innovation as their main differentiation strategy to maximize the utilization of resources. We further instrument CSR using the social expenditure ratio of the province where the firm is headquartered to address a potential endogeneity concern. Finally, we provide several prominent managerial implications for enterprises, governments, and investors.

TI  - Artificial Agents in Natural Moral Communities: A Brief Clarification
AU  - Tigard, DW
T2  - CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY OF HEALTHCARE ETHICS
AB  - What exactly is it that makes one morally responsible? Is it a set of facts which can be objectively discerned, or is it something more subjective, a reaction to the agent or context-sensitive interaction? This debate gets raised anew when we encounter newfound examples of potentially marginal agency. Accordingly, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the idea of "novel beings" represent exciting opportunities to revisit inquiries into the nature of moral responsibility. This paper expands upon my article "Artificial Moral Responsibility: How We Can and Cannot Hold Machines Responsible" and clarifies my reliance upon two competing views of responsibility. Although AI and novel beings are not close enough to us in kind to be considered candidates for the same sorts of responsibility we ascribe to our fellow human beings, contemporary theories show us the priority and adaptability of our moral attitudes and practices. This allows us to take seriously the social ontology of relationships that tie us together. In other words, moral responsibility is to be found primarily in the natural moral community, even if we admit that those communities now contain artificial agents.

AB  - Forestry work is one of the most difficult and dangerous professions in all production areas worldwide - therefore, any kind of occupational safety and any contribution to increasing occupational safety plays a major role, in line with addressing sustainability goal SDG 3 (good health and well-being). Detailed records of occupational accidents and the analysis of these data play an important role in understanding the interacting factors that lead to occupational accidents and, if possible, adjusting them for the future. However, the application of machine learning and knowledge extraction in this domain is still in its infancy, so this contribution is also intended to serve as a starting point and test bed for the future application of artificial intelligence in occupational safety and health, particularly in forestry. In this context, this study evaluates the accident data of Osterreichische Bundesforste AG (OBf), Austria's largest forestry company, for the years 2005-2021. Overall, there are 2481 registered accidents, 9 of which were fatal. For the task of forecasting the absence hours due to an accident as well as the classification of fatal or non-fatal cases, decision trees, random forests and fully-connected neuronal networks were used.

AB  - Through application of artificial intelligence (AI), the burden of analytical computational load for analysis of any given problem where countless variables have to be taken into account, is virtually eliminated. Since for engagements in real life operations and instantaneous actions are of paramount importance and vital, AI can be a strong alternative to overcome the complex problem solving in short time frames. As such, in this study a brief review of AI basics is given and literature for AI applications in nuclear field such as defect detection in nuclear fuel assembly, dose prediction in nuclear emergencies, fuel and component failure detection, core monitoring for reactor transients, core fuel optimization models, gamma spectroscopy analysis and specifically nuclear reactor safety in operation are assessed. Afterwards, an AI model for analyzing transients in VVER type nuclear power plants that is being built in Turkey is proposed. This model must keep up with instantaneous data flow and giving actionable feedback to the operator both for the cause and the solution. A semi-autonomous AI control system that help the operator decision making is a significant contributor to the safety of a reactor.

AB  - Many sets of ethics principles for responsible AI have been proposed to allay concerns about misuse and abuse of AI/ML systems. The underlying aspects of such sets of principles include privacy, accuracy, fairness, robustness, explainability, and transparency. However, there are potential tensions between these aspects that pose difficulties for AI/ML developers seeking to follow these principles. For example, increasing the accuracy of an AI/ML system may reduce its explainability. As part of the ongoing effort to operationalise the principles into practice, in this work we compile and discuss a catalogue of 10 notable tensions, trade-offs and other interactions between the underlying aspects. We primarily focus on two-sided interactions, drawing on support spread across a diverse literature. This catalogue can be helpful in raising awareness of the possible interactions between aspects of ethics principles, as well as facilitating well-supported judgements by the designers and developers of AI/ML systems.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significant disruption not only on how schools operate but also affected student sentiments on learning and adoption to different learning strategies. We propose CampusPandemicPlanR, a reinforcement learning-based simulation tool that could be applied to suggest to campus operators how many students from each course to allow on a campus classroom each week. The tool aims to strike a balance between the conflicting goals of keeping students from getting infected, on one hand, and allowing more students to come into campus to allow them to benefit from in-person classes, on the other. Our preliminary results show that a Q-learning agent is able to learn better policies over iterations, and that different Pareto-optimal trade-offs between these conflicting goals could be obtained by varying the reward weight parameter.

AB  - Safety is a fundamental property for the realworld deployment of robotic platforms. Any control policy should avoid dangerous actions that could harm the environment, humans, or the robot itself. In reinforcement learning (RL), safety is crucial when exploring a new environment to learn a new skill. This paper introduces a new formulation of safe exploration for robotic RL in the tangent space of the constraint manifold that effectively transforms the action space of the RL agent for always respecting safety constraints locally. We show how to apply this approach to a wide range of robotic platforms and how to define safety constraints that represent dynamic articulated objects like humans in the context of robotic RL. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulated high-dimensional and dynamic tasks while avoiding collisions with the environment. We show safe real-world deployment of our learned controller on a TIAGo++ robot, achieving remarkable performance in manipulation and human-robot interaction tasks.

TI  - Robot Responsibility and Moral Community
AU  - Gogoshin, DL
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI
AB  - It is almost a foregone conclusion that robots cannot be morally responsible agents, both because they lack traditional features of moral agency like consciousness, intentionality, or empathy and because of the apparent senselessness of holding them accountable. Moreover, although some theorists include them in the moral community as moral patients, on the Strawsonian picture of moral community as requiring moral responsibility, robots are typically excluded from membership. By looking closely at our actual moral responsibility practices, however, I determine that the agency reflected and cultivated by them is limited to the kind of moral agency of which some robots are capable, not the philosophically demanding sort behind the traditional view. Hence, moral rule-abiding robots (if feasible) can be sufficiently morally responsible and thus moral community members, despite certain deficits. Alternative accountability structures could address these deficits, which I argue ought to be in place for those existing moral community members who share these deficits.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the medical industry. This paper first investigates the mechanism of patients' medical AI acceptance after experiencing AI service failure from the perspective of responsibility attribution. Using data from 249 patients in China, findings reveal that patients' self-responsibility attribution is positively related to human-computer trust (HCT) and sequentially enhances the acceptance of medical AI for independent diagnosis and treatment. This paper also investigates the moderating role of personality traits. Specifically, conscientiousness and openness strengthen the association between HCT and acceptance of AI for independent diagnosis and treatment; agreeableness and conscientiousness weaken the association between HCT and acceptance of AI for assistive diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - We developed a novel framework for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in task constrained path generation problems of robotic manipulators leveraging human demonstrated trajectories. The main contribution of this article is to design a reward function that can be used with generic reinforcement learning algorithms by utilizing the Koopman operator theory to build a human intent model from the human demonstrated trajectories. In order to ensure that the developed reward function produces the correct reward, the demonstrated trajectories are further used to create a trust domain within which the Koopman operator-based human intent prediction is considered. Otherwise, the proposed algorithm asks for human feedback to receive rewards. The designed reward function is incorporated inside the deep Q-learning (DQN) framework, which results in a modified DQN algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm is demonstrated using a simulated robotic arm to learn the paths for constrained end-effector motion and considering the safety of the human in the surroundings of the robot.

AB  - Drug-drug interaction (DDI) detection is an important issue of pharmacovigilance. Currently, approaches proposed to detection DDIs are mainly focused on data sources such as spontaneous reporting systems, electronic health records, chemical/pharmacological databases, and biomedical literatures. However, those data sources are limited either by low reporting ratio, access issue, or long publication time span. In this work, we propose to explore online health communities, a timely, informative and publicly available data source, for DDI detection. We construct a weighted heterogeneous healthcare network that contains drugs, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), diseases, and users extracted from online health consumer-contributed contents, extract topological features, develop weighted path count to quantify the features, and use supervised learning techniques to detect DDI signals. The experiment results show that weighted heterogeneous healthcare network using leverage and lift are more effective in DDI detection than both unweighted homogeneous and heterogeneous network.

AB  - Agents trained in simulation may make errors in the real world due to mismatches between training and execution environments. These mistakes can be dangerous and difficult to discover because the agent cannot predict them a priori. We propose using oracle feedback to learn a predictive model of these blind spots to reduce costly errors in real-world applications. We focus on blind spots in reinforcement learning (RL) that occur due to incomplete state representation: The agent does not have the appropriate features to represent the true state of the world and thus cannot distinguish among numerous states. We formalize the problem of discovering blind spots in RL as a noisy supervised learning problem with class imbalance. We learn models to predict blind spots in unseen regions of the state space by combining techniques for label aggregation, calibration, and supervised learning. The models take into consideration noise emerging from different forms of oracle feedback, including demonstrations and corrections. We evaluate our approach on two domains and show that it achieves higher predictive performance than baseline methods, and that the learned model can be used to selectively query an oracle at execution time to prevent errors. We also empirically analyze the biases of various feedback types and how they influence the discovery of blind spots.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Cross-modal remote sensing image-audio (RSIA) retrieval aims to use audio or remote sensing images (RSIs) as queries to retrieve relevant RSIs or corresponding audios. Although many approaches leverage labeled samples to achieve good performance, the performance cost of labeled samples is high, because cross-modal remote sensing (RS) labeled samples usually require huge labor resources. Therefore, unsupervised cross-modal learning is very important in real-world applications. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-modal RSIA retrieval approach, named self-supervision interactive alignment (SSIA), which can take advantage of large amounts of unlabeled samples to learn the salient information, cross-modal alignment, and the similarity between RSIs and audios. Since self-supervised learning lacks the supervision of label information, we leverage the similarity between the input RSI information and audio information as the supervision information. Besides, to perform cross-modal alignment, a novel interactive alignment (IA) module is designed to explore fine correspondence relation for RSIs and audios. Moreover, we design an audio-guided image de-redundant module to reduce the redundant information of visual information, which can capture salient information of RSIs. Extensive experiments on four widely used RSIA datasets testify that the SSIA performance gains better RSIA retrieval performance than other compared approaches.

AB  - This paper presents a new method to protect grid-interactive inverters against manipulated setpoints. The presented method applies an artificial intelligence-based stability criterion to detect harmful setpoints. The focus of this paper is on PQ-controlled inverters that can become unstable under weak grid conditions. This instability issue, which may unexpectedly happen in the nominal operating range of an inverter, is not observable under normal grid conditions. This paper formulates an embedded hybrid data-driven/analytical stability criterion to detect these hidden instability modes. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly enhance the security of inverters by examining a setpoint through the hybrid stability criterion prior to engaging the setpoint to the local controller. The findings of this work are experimentally verified using a small-scale two-level 208 V, 5 kVA inverter feeding a 12 kW NHR 9410 power grid emulator.

T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) has become widely adopted in robot control. Despite many successes, one major persisting problem can be very low data efficiency. One solution is interactive feedback, which has been shown to speed up RL considerably. As a result, there is an abundance of different strategies, which are, however, primarily tested on discrete grid-world and small scale optimal control scenarios. In the literature, there is no consensus about which feedback frequency is optimal or at which time the feedback is most beneficial. To resolve these discrepancies we isolate and quantify the effect of feedback frequency in robotic tasks with continuous state and action spaces. The experiments encompass inverse kinematics learning for robotic manipulator arms of different complexity. We show that seemingly contradictory reported phenomena occur at different complexity levels. Furthermore, our results suggest that no single ideal feedback frequency exists. Rather that feedback frequency should be changed as the agent's proficiency in the task increases.

AB  - In Interactive Machine Learning (IML), we iteratively make decisions and obtain noisy observations of an unknown function. While IML methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization and active learning, have been successful in applications, on real-world systems they must provably avoid unsafe decisions. To this end, safe IML algorithms must carefully learn about a priori unknown constraints without making unsafe decisions. Existing algorithms for this problem learn about the safety of all decisions to ensure convergence. This is sample-inefficient, as it explores decisions that are not relevant for the original IML objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that renders any existing unsafe IML algorithm safe. Our method works as an add-on that takes suggested decisions as input and exploits regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior in order to efficiently learn about their safety. As a result, we only explore the safe set when necessary for the IML problem. We apply our framework to safe Bayesian optimization and to safe exploration in deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP), which have been analyzed separately before. Our method outperforms other algorithms empirically.

T2  - ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS
AB  - Highway work zones are considered among the most hazardous working environments. In 2018 alone, 124 workers lost their lives to fatal accidents. The lack of predictive safety systems that notify workers of upcoming dangers in advance is a major reason to blame in the highway maintenance and operation community. This article presents an integrative design framework for bringing recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the safety of highway workers through real-time multimodal notifications on-spot. To this end, this article conceptualizes and co-designs three major pillars: (1) AR user interface design for multimodal notification, (2) real-time AI at the edge for vehicle detection/classification from distance, and (3) real-time wireless communication in work zone setting to enable latency-aware operation between AI and AR components. Our early results demonstrate that we can achieve 24.83 FPS end-to-end execution latency on the Xavier AGX Jetson board with 48.7% mAP on BDD100K dataset, and a real-time communication covering 120 meters with an average latency of 5.1 ms at the farthest distance. Our mixed-method user research also reveals an acceptable level of excitement and engagement from the body of highway workers toward both the proposed technology and the designed user interface. Overall, this article provides a proof-of-concept toward AI-enabled AR safety systems in highway work zones.

TI  - A flexible framework to coordinate debris clearance and relief distribution operations: A robust machine learning approach
AU  - Vahdani, B.
T2  - Expert Systems with Applications
AB  - This study aims to offer an integrated, flexible action plan to bridge two vital operations in the response phase of disaster management, namely debris clearance and relief items distribution. On this subject, a broad range of associated decisions, including location-allocation, inventory, scheduling, and routing, are reflected in a multi-period environment. Also, so as to provide a pliable decision chain, two substantial kinds of flexibility are considered, including network design and due dates. So, a new bi-objective mathematical model is proposed, where the first objective minimizes the total cost, and the second one minimizes the total operation time. Since travel time information accuracy has an undeniable influence on system performance, a new two-phase data-driven methodology, including a hybrid machine learning model and the distributionally robust optimization with φ- divergence, is offered to estimate reliable travel time and tackle its uncertainty. Additionally, the application and validation of the recommended model and solution methodology are investigated in a real case study. What is more, in order to explain the superiority of the proposed solution approach concerning robustness solution, various simulation experiments are executed. Ultimately, several numerical experiments are implemented, and captured results manifest that the proposed framework can enhance the system's performance. The obtained results reveal that considering the flexibility in network design and delivery date reduces the total costs and operation time by 7 and 6 percent. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate and prompt measurement of certain key variables occurring during wastewater treatment, especially effluent ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), is of great importance. In this study, a soft measurement model combining random forest (RF), enhanced atomic search optimization (EASO) and online sequential outlier robust extreme learning machine (OSORELM) is proposed for wastewater treatment. First, RF is used to select auxiliary variables with high correlation of NH4-N and BOD as model inputs. Second, a dynamic perturbation strategy and a generalized opposition-based learning are added to ASO to improve the algorithm performance. And EASO is used for model hyperparameter optimization. Then, the optimized OSORELM model is used for soft measurements of NH4-N and BOD. Finally, to verify the stability of the model, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % noise were added for further experiments. The results show that the proposed model has better prediction and stronger robustness in soft measurements of NH4-N and BOD. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Traffic accidents are often inaccurately reported, with incorrect location and disruption duration due to various external factors. This can result in imprecise predictions and inaccurate decision-making in data-driven models. To address these challenges, our study presents a comprehensive framework for traffic disruption segmentation from traffic speed data (obtained from Caltrans Performance Measurements system) in the time-space proximity of reported accidents (from Countrywide Traffic Accident dataset). Furthermore, we evaluate multiple machine learning models on reported, estimated, and manually marked disruption intervals, and demonstrate that our enhanced modelling approach reduces the root mean squared error (RMSE) of traffic accident duration prediction while providing higher similarity with disruptions observed in traffic speed. Our algorithm yields higher disruption detection precision than reported accident timelines. Although using multiple segments offers a slight decrease in the quality of results, it highlights more disruptions. Future research could explore expanding the algorithm&#x2019;s complexity and applying it to improve traffic incident impact predictions. IEEE

T2  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
AB  - Sediment transport is a noteworthy task in the design and operation of sewer pipes. Decreasing sewer pipe hydraulic capacity and transport of pollution are the main consequences of continuous sedimentation. Among different design approaches, the non-deposition with deposited bed (NDB) method can be used for the design of large sewer pipes; however, existing models are established on limited data ranges and mostly applied conventional regression methods. The current study improves the NDB sediment transport modeling by utilizing wide data ranges, and furthermore, applying robust machine learning techniques. In the present study, the conventional extreme learning machine (ELM) technique and its advanced versions, namely the online sequential-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), outlier robust-extreme learning machine (OR-ELM), and parallel layer perceptron-extreme learning machine (PLP-ELM) are used for the modeling. In the studies conducted in the literature, sediment deposited bed thickness (ts) or deposited bed width (Wb) was used in the model structure as a deposited sediment variable, and therefore, different parameters in terms of ts and Wb can be incorporated into the model structure. However, an uncertainty arises in the selection of the appropriate parameter among Wb/Y, ts/Y, Wb/D, and ts/D (Y is flow depth and D circular pipe diameter). In order to define the most appropriate parameter to best describe the impact of deposited sediment at the channel bottom in the modeling procedure, four various scenarios using four different parameters that incorporate deposited sediment variables at their structures as Wb/Y, ts/Y, W/D, and ts/D are considered for model development. It is found that models that incorporate sediment bed thickness (ts) provide better results than those which use deposited bed width (Wb) in their structures. Among four different scenarios, models that utilized ts/D dimensionless parameter, give superior results in contrast to their alternatives. Based on the outcomes, the OR-ELM approach outperformed ELM, OS-ELM, and PLP-ELM techniques. The results obtained from applied methods are compared to their corresponding models in the literature, indicating the superiority of the OR-ELM model. It is figured out that the thickness of the deposited bed is an effective variable in modeling NDB sediment transport in sewer pipes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Unlike in other application sectors (such as self-driving road vehicles) where ODD development is scenario-based, our approach is data-centric: we propose the dimensions along which the parameters that define an ODD can be explicitly captured, together with a categorization of the data that ML-based applications can encounter in operation, whilst identifying their system-level relevance and impact. Specifically, we discuss how those data categories are useful to determine: the requirements necessary to drive the design of ML Models (MLMs); the potsince operating outside the flightential effects on MLMs and higher levels of the system hierarchy; the learning assurance processes that may be needed, and system architectural considerations. We illustrate the underlying concepts with an example of an aircraft flight envelope. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Increasing interdependencies between power and gas systems and integrating large-scale intermittent renewable energy increase the complexity of energy management problems. This paper proposes a model-free safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to find fast optimal energy flow (OEF), guaranteeing its feasibility in real-time operation with high computational efficiency. A constrained Markov decision process model is standardized for the optimization problem of OEF with a limited number of state and control actions and developing a robust integrated environment. Because state-of-the-art DRL algorithms lack safety guarantees, this paper develops a soft-constraint enforcement method to adaptively encourage the control policy in the safety direction with non-conservative control actions. The overall procedure, namely the constrained soft actor-critic (C-SAC) algorithm, is off-policy, entropy maximization-based, sample-efficient, and scalable with low hyper-parameter sensitivity. The proposed C-SAC algorithm validates its superiority over the existing learning-based safety ones and OEF solution methods by finding fast OEF decisions with near-zero degrees of constraint violations. The proposed approach indicates its practicability for real-time energy system operation and extensions for other potential applications. IEEE

AB  - Thermal error modeling and compensation is an important tool to improve the machining accuracy of machine tools. It is important to apply the obtained thermal error models to similar tasks to reduce the cost of model construction and data collection. In this article, an easy transfer learning (EasyTL) with intra-domain alignment method for spindle thermal error modeling is proposed to realize the transfer reuse of error models under different working conditions. Further, the respective effects of different types of intra-domain alignment and distance matrices on model migration performance are analyzed. Finally, the EasyTL model is compared and validated with machine learning kNN and deep learning CNN to predict the thermal errors of the Z-direction and Y-direction of spindle under different working conditions, respectively. This method provides a new idea for modeling and compensating the thermal errors of machine spindles. In addition, a workpiece compensation machining experiment is carried out according to the thermal error of the spindle established by the thermal error prediction. The average error of the workpiece after compensation is reduced. This method provides a new idea for the thermal error modeling and compensation. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Flood control operation is one of the effective measures to reduce flood risks. Since flood forecasting plays a critical role in real-time reservoir flood control operation, it is necessary to involve forecasting uncertainty in the optimal reservoir operation to inform decision-making. It has always been a difficult task to reduce flood risks by adjusting flood control strategies. To tackle this challenge, this study developed a multi-objective robust optimization methodology for real-time reservoir flood control operation, which mainly coped with forecast uncertainty. Three machine learning (ML) models, including back propagation neural network (BP), long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted to forecast the short-term reservoir inflow. A stacking ensemble multi-ML model (SEM) was then applied to integrate the forecasting results of the above models. Furthermore, a multi-objective robust optimal operation model (MOROU) integrating both upstream and downstream safety was established to reduce flood risks and evaluate the impact of forecasting uncertainty on the reservoir operation. To maximize the efficiency of reservoir utilization, this study defined a new indicator of reservoir reserved capacity adaptation (RRCA) as one of the optimization indicators. To better solve the complex multi-objective problem, a scenario to point (STP) method was proposed for searching robust solutions of multi-objective optimization models. Methodologies were validated through an application to the Lishimen reservoir, China. Three main conclusions were derived from the study: (1) Three ML models performed well in flood forecasting with BP being slightly better than the other two, and the SEM method was found to be able to incorporate the characteristics of each model, outperforming the individual models; (2) MOROU showed a narrower distribution of flood risk both upstream and downstream and achieved an approximately 1.5% reduction in the maximum value of the highest water level; (3) RRCA was verified to enable to reduce the discharge flow by an average of 4.52% without occupying additional flood control reservoir capacity, confirming that it can be used as an optimization indicator to improve the utilization of the reservoir. The proposed method can provide robust strategies for real-time reservoir flood control under forecast uncertainty. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In modern complicated and changing manufacturing environments, unforeseen dynamic events such as machine breakdown or unexpected job arrival make required production resources unpredictable. The scheduling scheme is desired to maintain high stability in dynamic manufacturing environments. To cope with the classic disturbance of machine breakdown, a robust pro-active scheduling scheme is proposed by inserting the repair time into a disjunctive graph for reinforcement learning (IRDRL) in this paper. Firstly, a new mathematical model is developed to predict the machine fault which is assumed to be determined by service time and bearing load. Secondly, a disjunctive graph with breakdown information is designed to express the dynamic scheduling status. Then, an online scheduling framework is built based on the well-trained model through the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Finally, compared with the classical methods such as the right-shift strategy and static model of reinforcement learning (RL), the proposed robust pro-active scheduling scheme is verified with high robustness, stability, and short running time. © IMechE 2023.

AB  - Social network alignment, aiming at linking identical identities across different social platforms, is a fundamental task in social graph mining. Most existing approaches are supervised models and require a large number of manually labeled data, which are infeasible in practice considering the yawning gap between social platforms. Recently, isomorphism across social networks is incorporated as complementary to link identities from the distribution level, which contributes to alleviating the dependency on sample-level annotations. Adversarial learning is adopted to learn a shared projection function by minimizing the distance between two social distributions. However, the hypothesis of isomorphism might not always hold true as social user behaviors are generally unpredictable, and thus a shared projection function is insufficient to handle the sophisticated cross-platform correlations. In addition, adversarial learning suffers from training instability and uncertainty, which may hinder model performance. In this article, we propose a novel meta-learning-based social network alignment model Meta-SNA to effectively capture the isomorphism and the unique characteristics of each identity. Our motivation lies in learning a shared meta-model to preserve the global cross-platform knowledge and an adaptor to learn a specific projection function for each identity. Sinkhorn distance is further introduced as the distribution closeness measurement to tackle the limitations of adversarial learning, which owns an explicitly optimal solution and can be efficiently computed by the matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed model over multiple datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Meta-SNA. IEEE

AB  - The risk of transmission overload (TO) in power grids is increasing with the large-scale integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. An effective online preventive control schemes proves to be vital in safeguarding the security of power systems. In this paper, we formulate the online preventive control problem for TO alleviation as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), targeted to reduce the load rate of overloaded lines by implementing generation re-dispatch, transmission and busbar switching actions. The CMDP is solved with a state-of-the-art safe deep reinforcement learning method, based on the computationally efficient interior-point policy optimization (IPO), which facilitates desirable learning behavior towards constraint satisfaction and policy improvement simultaneously. The performance of IPO method is further improved with an enhanced perception of spatial-temporal correlations in power gird nodal and edge features, combining the strength of edge conditioned convolutional network and long short-term memory network, fostering more effective and robust preventive control policies to be devised. Case studies on a real-world system and a large-scale system validate the superior performance of the proposed method in TO alleviation, constraint handling, uncertainty adaptability and stability preservation, as well as its favorable computational performance, through benchmarking against both model-based and reinforcement learning-based baseline methods.

AB  - Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are well proved to be capable to provide operating reserve for power systems. As a type of large-capacity and energy-efficient HVAC system (up to 100 MW), district cooling system (DCS) is emerging in modern cities and has huge potential to be regulated as a flexible load. However, strategically controlling a DCS to provide flexibility is challenging, because one DCS services multiple buildings with complex thermal dynamics and uncertain cooling demands. Improper control may lead to significant thermal discomfort and even deteriorate the power system&#x0027;s operation security. To address the above issues, we propose a model-free control strategy based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) without the requirement of accurate system model and uncertainty distribution. To avoid damaging &#x201C;trial &amp; error&#x201D; actions that may violate the system&#x0027;s operation security during the training process, we further propose a safe layer combined to the DDPG to guarantee the satisfaction of critical constraints, forming a safe-DDPG scheme. Moreover, after providing operating reserve, DCS increases power and tries to recover all the buildings&#x0027; temperature back to set values, which may cause an instantaneous peak-power rebound and bring a secondary negative impact on power systems. Therefore, we design a self-adaption reward function within the proposed safe-DDPG scheme to constrain the peak-power effectively. Numerical studies based on a realistic DCS demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. IEEE

AB  - As the profit and safety requirements become higher and higher, it is more and more necessary to realize an advanced intelligent analysis for abnormity forecast of the synthetical balance of material and energy (AF-SBME) on aluminum reduction cells (ARCs). Without loss of generality, AF-SBME belongs to classification problems. Its advanced intelligent analysis can be realized by high-performance data-driven classifiers. However, AF-SBME has some difficulties, including a high requirement for interpretability of data-driven classifiers, a small number, and decreasing-over-time correctness of training samples. In this article, based on a preferable data-driven classifier, which is called a reinforced <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$k$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-nearest neighbor (R-KNN) classifier, a delicately R-KNN combined with expert knowledge (DR-KNN/CE) is proposed. It improves R-KNN in two ways, including using expert knowledge as external assistance and enhancing self-ability to mine and synthesize data knowledge. The related experiments on AF-SBME, where the relevant data are directly sampled from practical production, have demonstrated that the proposed DR-KNN/CE not only makes an effective improvement for R-KNN, but also has a more advanced performance compared with other existing high-performance data-driven classifiers.

AB  - Deep neural networks have shown vulnerability to well-designed inputs called adversarial examples. Researchers in industry and academia have proposed many adversarial example defense techniques. However, they offer partial but not full robustness. Thus, complementing them with another layer of protection is a must, especially for mission-critical applications. This article proposes a novel online selection and relabeling algorithm (OSRA) that opportunistically utilizes a limited number of crowdsourced workers to maximize the machine learning (ML) system&#x0027;s robustness. The OSRA strives to use crowdsourced workers effectively by selecting the most suspicious inputs and moving them to the crowdsourced workers to be validated and corrected. As a result, the impact of adversarial examples gets reduced, and accordingly, the ML system becomes more robust. We also proposed a heuristic threshold selection method that contributes to enhancing the prediction system&#x0027;s reliability. We empirically validated our proposed algorithm and found that it can efficiently and optimally utilize the allocated budget for crowdsourcing. It is also effectively integrated with a state-of-the-art black box defense technique, resulting in a more robust system. Simulation results show that the OSRA can outperform a random selection algorithm by 60&#x0025; and achieve comparable performance to an optimal offline selection benchmark. They also show that OSRA&#x0027;s performance has a positive correlation with system robustness. IEEE

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
AB  - Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely developed to enable real-time security assessment for large-scale electricity grids. However, it also has been extensively recognized that the ML models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are slightly perturbed instances that can mislead the classifications but cannot be distinguished by human eyes. Considering the adversarial examples against the ML-based security assessment, they must not only cause misclassification but also follow the power balance and transfer limits and bypass the bad data detection. To this end, this paper proposes a novel concept named physics-constrained robustness that aims to computing a lower-bound of adversarial perturbations, evaluating the vulnerability of the ML-based intelligent security assessment (ISA) for power systems. A general optimization problem is formulated to compute the physics-constrained robustness of ISA with the mislabeling, power balance, power limitation, and invisible constraints. The analytical results and comparing relationship of ISA's robustness with different constraints are provided. By using the static security assessment as an example, we provide explicit formulations to evaluate the physics-constrained robustness of. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the physics-constrained robustness of ISA in static and dynamic cases with the real-world load profiles from New York State and provide suggestions to select the ML models and parameters.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Fast and safe voltage regulation algorithms can serve as fundamental schemes for achieving a high level of renewable penetration in the modern distribution power grids. Faced with uncertain or even unknown distribution grid models and fast-changing power injections, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been proposed to find the reactive power injections for inverters while optimizing the voltage profiles. However, such data-driven controllers can not guarantee satisfaction of the hard operational constraints, such as maintaining voltage profiles within a certain range of the nominal value. To this end, we propose SAVER: SAfe VoltagE Regulator, which is composed of an RL learner and a specifically designed, computational efficient safety projection layer. SAVER provides a plug-and-play interface for a set of DRL algorithms that guarantees the system voltages to be within safe bounds most of the time. Numerical simulations on real-world data validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - At present, smart Homes are receiving more attention as they are becoming the predominant space that houses people's activities. Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents' quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people's lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it's aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we'll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we'll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We'll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we'll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents' quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, 'home operating system' featuring life-long learning of users' dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents' lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system's coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The influence of a deep excavation on existing shield tunnels nearby is a vital issue in tunnelling engineering. Whereas, there lacks robust methods to predict excavation-induced tunnel displacements. In this study, an auto machine learning (AutoML)-based approach is proposed to precisely solve the issue. Seven input parameters are considered in the database covering two physical aspects, namely soil property, and spatial characteristics of the deep excavation. The 10-fold cross-validation method is employed to overcome the scarcity of data, and promote model's robustness. Six genetic algorithm (GA)-ML models are established as well for comparison. The results indicated that the proposed AutoML model is a comprehensive model that integrates efficiency and robustness. Importance analysis reveals that the ratio of the average shear strength to the vertical effective stress Eur/σv′, the excavation depth H, and the excavation width B are the most influential variables for the displacements. Finally, the AutoML model is further validated by practical engineering. The prediction results are in a good agreement with monitoring data, signifying that our model can be applied in real projects. © 2022 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Hebbian plasticity in winner-take-all (WTA) networks is highly attractive for neuromorphic on-chip learning, owing to its efficient, local, unsupervised, and on-line nature. Moreover, its biological plausibility may help overcome important limitations of artificial algorithms, such as their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and their high demands for training-example quantity and repetition. However, Hebbian WTA learning has found little use in machine learning, likely because it has been missing an optimization theory compatible with deep learning (DL). Here we show rigorously that WTA networks constructed by standard DL elements, combined with a Hebbian-like plasticity that we derive, maintain a Bayesian generative model of the data. Importantly, without any supervision, our algorithm, SoftHebb, minimizes cross-entropy, i.e. a common loss function in supervised DL. We show this theoretically and in practice. The key is a ‘soft’ WTA where there is no absolute ‘hard’ winner neuron. Strikingly, in shallow-network comparisons with backpropagation, SoftHebb shows advantages beyond its Hebbian efficiency. Namely, it converges in fewer iterations, and is significantly more robust to noise and adversarial attacks. Notably, attacks that maximally confuse SoftHebb are also confusing to the human eye, potentially linking human perceptual robustness, with Hebbian WTA circuits of cortex. Finally, SoftHebb can generate synthetic objects as interpolations of real object classes. All in all, Hebbian efficiency, theoretical underpinning, cross-entropy-minimization, and surprising empirical advantages, suggest that SoftHebb may inspire highly neuromorphic and radically different, but practical and advantageous learning algorithms and hardware accelerators. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Robust Power System Stability Assessment against Adversarial Machine Learning-based Cyberattacks via Online Purification
AU  - Zhao, T.
AU  - Yue, M.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Power Systems
AB  - The increasing complexity associated with renewable generation brings more challenges to power system stability assessment (SA). Data-driven approaches based on machine learning (ML) techniques for stability assessment have received significant research interest and shown their promising performance. However, ML-based models are recognized to be vulnerable to adversarial disturbances, where a slight perturbation to power system measurements could lead to unacceptable errors. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel lightweight mitigation strategy, i.e., robust online stability assessment (ROSA), to enhance the ML-based assessment model against both white-box and the black-box adversarial disturbances (i.e., purification) in the online implementation. The ROSA involves a supervised learning-based module for the primary stability assessment and a self-supervised learning-based module. The two modules are trained jointly with different objective (loss) functions and implemented in sequence. A suitable purification objective and various time-series data augmentation methods are designed for SA applications to tackle adversarial disturbances adaptively. Case studies are performed, and the comparative results have clearly illustrated the competitive, robust accuracy against various adversarial scenarios and verified the effectiveness of the proposed online purification strategy.

TI  - Sustainable power systems operations under renewable energy induced disjunctive uncertainties via machine learning-based robust optimization
AU  - Zhao, N.

T2  - Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
AB  - For sustainable and reliable power systems operations integrating variable renewable energy, it is essential to incorporate the uncertain intermittent power outputs. A novel robust unit commitment framework with data-driven disjunctive uncertainty sets is proposed for sustainable energy systems with volatile renewable wind power, assisted by machine learning. The approach can flexibly identify the uncertainty space based on renewable power forecast error data with disjunctive structures. Specifically, the uncertainty data are grouped using K-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) following the optimal cluster number determined by the Calinski-Harabasz index. Disjunctive uncertainty sets are constructed accordingly as the union of multiple basic uncertainty sets, including conventional box and budget uncertainty sets, and data-driven uncertainty sets using Dirichlet process mixture model, principal component analysis coupled with kernel density estimation, and support vector clustering. Subsequently, the problem is formulated into a two-stage adaptive robust unit commitment model with data-driven disjunctive uncertainty sets and with a multi-level optimization structure. To facilitate the solution process, a tailored decomposition-based optimization algorithm is developed. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework are illustrated with two case studies investigating sustainable operations scheduling based on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, considering the integration of intermittent renewable energy. Results show that the proposed framework can reduce the price of robustness by 8–48% compared to the conventional “one-set-fits-all” robust optimization approaches. Benchmarking with stochastic programming indicates that the proposed framework can achieve the same or better economic performance for sustainable operations with over 75% less computational time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Monitoring the operational performance of the sawmilling industry has become important for many applications including strategic and tactical planning. Small-scale sawmilling facilities do not hold automatic production management capabilities mainly due to using obsolete technology which is an effect of low financial capacity and focus their strategy on increasing value recovery and saving resources and energy. Based on triaxial acceleration data collected over five days at a sampling rate of 1 Hz, a robust machine learning model was developed with the purpose of using it to infer the operational events based on lower sampling rates adopted as a strategy to collect long-term data. Among its performance metrics, the model was characterized in its training phase by a very high overall classification accuracy (CA = 98.7%), F1 score (98.4%) and a very low error rate (LOG LOSS = 5.6%). For a three-class problem, it worked very well in classifying the main events related to the operation of the machine, with active work being characterized by an F1 score of 99.6% and an error of 3.6%. By accounting for the same metrics, the model was proven to be invariant to the sampling rates of up to 0.05 Hz (20 s) and produced even better results in the testing phase (CA = 98.9%, F1 = 98.6%, LOG LOSS = 5.5%, for a testing sample extracted at 0.05 Hz), while there were no differences in the share of class data irrespective of the sampling rate. The developed model not only preserves a high classification performance in the training and testing phases but it also seems to be invariant to lower sampling rates, making it useful for prediction over data collected at low sampling rates. In turn, this would enable the use of cheap data collectors to be operated for extended periods of time in various locations and will save human resources and money associated with data collection. Further tests would be required only for validation and they could be supported by collecting and feeding new data to the model to infer the long-term performance of similar sawmilling machines. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A robust machine learning model for monitoring online voltage stability
AU  - Nageswara Rao, A.

T2  - International Journal of Ambient Energy
AB  - Continuous assessment of voltage stability (VS) is an important aspect to safeguard electrical power system (EPS) operation. The conservative methods for online assessment in terms of stability check for voltage are extremely time consuming and also absurd for supervising any application online. In agreement with this, a model which is an amalgamation of the Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and support vector machine (SVM) is aimed at supervising the VS in the paper. The method anticipated for the aforesaid problem utilises the magnitude of voltage and its corresponding phase angle which are attained from the PMU as the inputs to the ML model and the respective output are considered to be the voltage stability margin index (VSMI). The proficiency of the anticipated model (SSA–SVM) is verified by means of various test cases under the real-time scenario and compared with the same data set to attest its pre-eminence. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper deals with an innovative idea for kids to learn about road safety in an effective way of AI interfaced learning using Virtual Reality (VR). The game has five levels. At each level, kids will learn different types of traffic rules interactively. A method of supervised learning is followed by the AI module in the game to teach and guide the player. The first level teaches the kids about the pedestrian rules that should be followed by pedestrians. The second level is much more interesting where the kids will learn about the traffic signs. In the third level kids will get to know about the road safety rules that must be followed by a two-wheeler driver. In the fourth level, the kids will know about the traffic rules that must be followed by a four-wheeler driver. Finally, the kids will learn how and where to park a vehicle on the fifth level. After each level, the player must attend a quiz just to have a self-evaluation to have an idea of what they have learned. The quizzes are based on the random forest algorithm, which randomly selects questions based on the level played previously. These AI modules were integrated with a navmesh agent given in unity software. The whole game is experienced on the VR platform with AI interfacing. So, the kids can get a real-time adventure and can learn things in a virtual-practical manner. This makes the learning part easy, interesting, and fun. © 2022 IEEE.

T2  - Big Data and Mobility as a Service
AB  - In this chapter, we introduce the data-driven optimization technologies that can be applied in the Mobility as a Service (MaaS) systems in the context of operational research and management science, emphasizing both theoretical and applicable perspectives. Specifically, we give a detailed overview of data-driven optimization technologies which have been widely used in the existing urban mobility system, such as data-driven dispatching methods for on-demand ridesharing services, data-driven scheduling methods for public transit, and data-driven rebalancing methods for bicycle-sharing in Section 1. We divided the characteristics of MaaS system in the existing literature into eight groups and provide different types of data generated from MaaS system and MaaS ecosystem in Section 2. Since resource allocation relies on optimization problems generating unsolved challenges in smart mobility, we provide a general MaaS framework via resource allocation and introduce both deterministic online mobility resource allocation problems and stochastic online mobility resource allocation problems in Section 3. Further, we introduce more data-driven optimization technologies which are applicable for the mobility resource allocation problems in MaaS systems in Section 4. Finally, we present a real-world case study conducted in in Tokyo, Japan, using data derived from mobile phone records in Section 5. This chapter aims to disseminate the latest findings, research achievements, and ideas on MaaS through the lens of data-driven optimization, to balance theoretical research ideas and their practicability as well as industrial applicability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - When the wearer of Wearable Human-Machine Interaction System (WHMIS) is talking a strenuous walk, the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) installed on the extremities are likely to be beyond the range of design specification of the IMU sensors. This overrange leads to poor navigation performances of the system. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes a deep learning-based method to realize robust autonomous navigation. Specifically, the Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) is built to recognize the gait types of the wearer. For each gait type, the inertial data of the wearer's thigh and the foot are collected at the same frequency as the training samples, and then used to construct a correspondent Gated Recurrent Unit-Support Vector Regression (GRU-SVR) deep hybrid neural network model for virtual IMU simulation. Then, the virtual foot-mounted IMU will be constructed in real-time by the physical thigh-mounted IMU based on the neural network models mentioned above. Once the over-range of the physical foot-mounted IMU is detected, the virtual foot inertial information will be used to reconstruct the WHMIS navigation system. Experimental results show that the proposed navigation method has the ability of fault tolerance in complex gaits, and the 3D positioning performance of the reconstructed navigation system is approximately equivalent to that of the fault-free WHMIS navigation system.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AU  - Wang, Y.

T2  - Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems
AB  - Robust reinforcement learning (RL) is to find a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of MDPs. In this paper, we focus on model-free robust RL, where the uncertainty set is defined to be centering at a misspecified MDP that generates a single sample trajectory sequentially, and is assumed to be unknown. We develop a sample-based approach to estimate the unknown uncertainty set, and design robust Q-learning algorithm (tabular case) and robust TDC algorithm (function approximation setting), which can be implemented in an online and incremental fashion. For the robust Q-learning algorithm, we prove that it converges to the optimal robust Q function, and for the robust TDC algorithm, we prove that it converges asymptotically to some stationary points. Unlike the results in [Roy et al., 2017], our algorithms do not need any additional conditions on the discount factor to guarantee the convergence. We further characterize the finite-time error bounds of the two algorithms, and show that both the robust Q-learning and robust TDC algorithms converge as fast as their vanilla counterparts (within a constant factor). Our numerical experiments further demonstrate the robustness of our algorithms. Our approach can be readily extended to robustify many other algorithms, e.g., TD, SARSA, and other GTD algorithms. © 2021 Neural information processing systems foundation. All rights reserved.

T2  - Informatics in Medicine Unlocked
AB  - Drug–drug interaction (DDI) is a major public health problem contributing to 30% of the unexpected clinical adverse drug events. Informatics-based studies for DDI signal detection have been evolving in the last decade. We aim at providing a boosted machine learning (ML) framework to predict novel DDI safety signals with high precision. We propose a similarity-based machine learning framework called “SMDIP” using DrugBank as one of the most reliable pharmaceutical knowledge bases. For this study, DrugBank provides the latest drug information in terms of DDIs, targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers. We computed drug–drug similarities using a Russell–Rao measure for the available biological and structural information on DrugBank for representing the sparse feature space. Logistic regression is adopted to conduct DDI classification with a focus on searching for key similarity predictors. Six types of ML models are deployed on the selected DDI key features. Our study reveals that SMDIP has yielded favourable predictive performance compared to relevant studies with results as follows: AUC 76%, precision 82%, accuracy 79%, recall 62%, specificity 90%, and F-measure 78%. To further confirm the reliability and reproducibility of SMDIP, we investigate SMDIP on an unseen subset of direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) drugs for treating hepatitis C infections. Forty novel DAA DDIs are predicted that show consistency with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of these drugs. Furthermore, several reports from the pharmacovigilance literature corroborate our framework results. Those evaluations show that SMDIP is a promising framework for uncovering DDIs, which can be multifariously feasible in drug development, postmarketing surveillance, and public health fields. © 2021 The Authors

T2  - Language and Concept Acquisition from Infancy Through Childhood: Learning from Multiple Exemplars
AB  - This book examines the role of experience-based learning on children’s acquisition of language and concepts. It reviews, compares, and contrasts accounts of how the opportunity to recognize and generalize patterns influences learning. The book offers the first systematic integration of three highly influential research traditions in the domains of language and concept acquisition: Statistical Learning, Structural Alignment, and the Bayesian learning perspective. Chapters examine the parameters that constrain learning, address conditions that optimize learning, and offer explanations for cases in which implicit exemplar-based learning fails to occur. By exploring both the benefits and challenges children face as they learn from multiple examples, the book offers insight on how to better able to understand children’s early unsupervised learning about language and concepts. Topics featured in this book include: Competing models of statistical learning and how learning might be constrained by infants’ developing cognitive abilities. How experience with multiple exemplars helps infants understand space and other relations. The emergence of category-based inductive reasoning during infancy and early childhood. How children learn individual verbs and the verb system over time. How statistical learning leads to aggregation and abstraction in word learning. Mechanisms for evaluating others’ reliability as sources of knowledge when learning new words. The Search for Invariance (SI) hypothesis and its role in facilitating causal learning. Language and Concept Acquisition from Infancy Through Childhood is an essential resource for researchers, clinicians and related professionals, and graduate students in infancy and early child development, applied linguistics, language education, child, school, and developmental psychology and related mental health and education services. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020, Corrected Publication 2020.

TI  - A Framework for Building Uncertainty Wrappers for AI/ML-Based Data-Driven Components

T2  - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)
AB  - More and more software-intensive systems include components that are data-driven in the sense that they use models based on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). Since the outcomes of such models cannot be assumed to always be correct, related uncertainties must be understood and taken into account when decisions are made using these outcomes. This applies, in particular, if such decisions affect the safety of the system. To date, however, hardly any AI-/ML-based model provides dependable estimates of the uncertainty remaining in its outcomes. In order to address this limitation, we present a framework for encapsulating existing models applied in data-driven components with an uncertainty wrapper in order to enrich the model outcome with a situation-aware and dependable uncertainty statement. The presented framework is founded on existing work on the concept and mathematical foundation of uncertainty wrappers. The application of the framework is illustrated using pedestrian detection as an example, which is a particularly safety-critical feature in the context of autonomous driving. The Brier score and its components are used to investigate how the key aspects of the framework (scoping, clustering, calibration, and confidence limits) can influence the quality of uncertainty estimates. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have broad applications in the automotive, avionics, robotics, healthcare, and power grid, where the cyber components involving information processing and networking closely interact with the physical processes. Conventionally, there is a separate design flow of CPS. For instance, control algorithms managing the physical dynamics are designed using model-based approaches, without considering details of the cyber implementation platforms. Modern CPS are getting increasingly intelligent and connected. A new design methodology taking all the layers of CPS and their interplays into account is being developed, aiming for assurance of safety and security, as well as high robustness and resource efficiency. This chapter presents the technical background of CPS, with an emphasis on the cyber and physical interactions, corresponding to the new design methodology. Case studies on connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are used to illustrate the most recent development in CPS. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The widespread application of advanced renewable systems with optimal design can promote the cleaner production, reduce the carbon dioxide emission and realise the renewable and sustainable development. In this study, a phase change material integrated hybrid system was demonstrated, involving with advanced energy conversions and multi-diversified energy forms, including solar-to-electricity conversion, active water-based and air-based cooling, and distributed storages. A generic optimization methodology was developed by integrating supervised machine learning and heuristic optimization algorithms. Multivariable optimizations were systematically conducted for widespread application purpose in five climatic regions in China. Results showed that, the energy performance is highly dependent on mass flow rate and inlet cooling water temperature with contribution ratios at around 90% and 7%. Furthermore, compared to Taguchi standard orthogonal array, the machine-learning based optimization can improve the annual equivalent overall output energy from 86934.36 to 90597.32 kWh (by 4.2%) in ShangHai, from 86335.35 to 92719.07 (by 7.4%) in KunMing, from 87445.1 to 91218.3 (by 4.3%) in GuangZhou, from 87278.24 to 88212.83 (by 1.1%) in HongKong, and from 87611.95 to 92376.46 (by 5.4%) in HaiKou.

TI  - Stochastic uncertainty-based optimisation on an aerogel glazing building in China using supervised learning surrogate model and a heuristic optimisation algorithm
AU  - Zhou, Y.
AU  - Zheng, S.
T2  - Renewable Energy
AB  - Scenario parameters of aerogel glazing systems are with uncertainties in the real operation, whereas current literature fails to characterise the thermal and energy responses regarding stochastic scenario uncertainties. Furthermore, multi-level uncertainty-based optimisation has been rarely studied for the robustness improvement. In this study, a general method for stochastic uncertainties-based optimisation is proposed. A machine-learning based surrogate model is developed for uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, a multi-level uncertainty-based optimisation function is characterized and integrated with the heuristic teaching-learning-based algorithm to search for the optimal design. Research results indicated that, in the multi-level uncertainty-based optimal scenario, average values of RoC, thickness of aerogel layer, extinction coefficient and thermal conductivity are 306253.4 J/(K m3), 24.5 mm, 0.092, and 0.0214 W/(m K). Compared to the deterministic case, the stochastic uncertainty case can decrease the heat flux from 237.16 to 190 kWh/m2.a by 19.9%, and total heat gain from 267.18 to 222.04 kWh/m2.a by 16.9%. Furthermore, by adopting the multi-level uncertainty-based optimisation, the heat flux can be further reduced to 162.54 kWh/m2.a by 31.5%, and the total heat gain to 191.56 kWh/m2.a by 28.3%. The proposed technique can improve the reliability of aerogel glazing systems in green buildings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Energy Conversion and Management
AB  - As the wind energy developing, wind speed prediction is important for the reliability of wind power system and the integration of wind energy into the power network. This paper proposed a novel model based on hybrid mode decomposition (HMD) method and online sequential outlier robust extreme learning machine (OSORELM) for short-term wind speed prediction. In data pre-processing period, wind speed is deeply decomposed by HMD, which is comprised of variational mode decomposition (VMD), sample entropy (SE) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The crisscross algorithm (CSO) is applied to optimize the input-weights and hidden layer biases for OSORELM, which have impact on the forecasting performance. The experiment results show that: (a) HMD is an effective way of wind speed decomposition, which can capture the characteristics of wind speed time series accurately and thus promote the prediction performance; (b) the OSORELM performs better than offline models in practical forecasting; (c) the proposed forecasting model has greatly improved the accuracy in multi-step wind speed forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Sarkar, J.

T2  - IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings
AB  - Solid-state storage technology is finding increasing adoption in enterprise and data center environments due to their high reliability and reducing cost. With high performance solid-state storage devices (SSDs) internally designed as distributed resilient systems, their operational behavior under materially different workloads is described in this research. Application of interpretable machine learning on internal parametric data of SSDs enables insights on workloads' interaction with the resilient system design. After prior research demonstrated significantly different accelerated workload stress, the analysis on resilience of the SSDs under random vs. pseudo-sequential workloads emphasize the efficacy and importance of their distributed resilience schemes. As such, these results provide causational insights on the mechanism of differential stress of the workloads impacting the resilience design principles. Moreover, the results elucidate guidelines strongly relevant from design robustness perspective for research on novel SSD architectures such as the proposed Open Channel SSD, towards deployment in hyperscale and virtualization environments. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - We introduce algorithms for online, full-information prediction that are computationally efficient and competitive with contextual tree experts of unknown complexity, in both probabilistic and adversarial settings. We incorporate a novel probabilistic framework of structural risk minimization into existing adaptive algorithms and show that we can robustly learn not only the presence of stochastic structure when it exists, but also the correct model order. When the stochastic data is actually realized from a predictor in the model class considered, we obtain regret bounds that are competitive with the regret of an optimal algorithm that possesses strong side information about both the true model order and whether the process generating the data is stochastic or adversarial. In cases where the data does not arise from any of the models, our algorithm selects models of higher order as we play more rounds. We display empirically improved overall prediction error over other adversarially robust approaches. © 2019 by the author(s).

AB  - The Lower Cretaceous Zubair Formation is a regionally extended oil-producing sandstone sequence in Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Wellbore instability is frequently reported as one of the most significant incidents while drilling this formation in several fields of Southern Iraq. Wellbore instability-related problems include borehole breakouts and tensile failure, which may lead to stuck pipe, reaming, sidetracking, and loss of circulation. In the present research, first, a comprehensive one-dimensional mechanical earth model (1D-MEM) was constructed based on well logging data, elastic moduli of rock, and appropriate failure criteria to determine the safe operating mud weight window of the Zubair Formation. The accuracy of the developed model was evaluated by comparing the predicted wellbore instability with the actual wellbore failure shown on caliper logs at a given mud weight. Then, appropriate machine-learning algorithms [i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and a support vector machine (SVM)] were used to establish a relationship between well logging data and safe operating mud weight window, which could be used to drill future wells successfully. The learning process was conducted in such a way that conventional well logging data [i. e., compressional wave transit times (DTCO), shear wave transit times (DTSM), density (RHOZ), total porosity (PHIT), and gamma-ray (GR)] were the inputs and the safe operating mud weight window was the output. The results obtained from the developed ANNs and SVM were compared with the real condition in drilled oil wells in the related field which were so promising. The proposed ANNs and SVM approaches can be used as cost-effective tools when planning for future neighboring wells to create better drilling efficiency by reducing the nonproductive time (NPT) and well costs.

AB  - In the last decade, a real revolution in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) led from the “overt” detection of human intention to the " covert” assessment of the actual human mental states. While the first aspect is the basis of the traditional BCI systems, the latter represents the outcome of the passive BCI applications. In fact, passive BCI derives its outputs from brain activity arising without the purpose of voluntary control, but implicitly related to the human mental state. The necessity of monitoring human mental states driven by safety-critical application has been just the boost to the passive BCIs developing: more in general, passive BCI represents the implicit channel of information that enhances the goal-oriented cooperation of humans and machines as a whole, the so-called human-machine interaction. So far, there have been countless passive BCI applications in a wide range of contexts such as driving, gaming, and surgery. If on the one hand, this has been possible thanks to the development of more and more discrete neurotechnological devices, on the other hand, we must not overlook the significant step forward in the employed algorithms, with the adoption in this field of machine learning and deep learning enhancements. This chapter will retrace not only the major achievements but also the future trends, in terms of technologies, methods, and applications of what concerns the field of passive BCIs. The final aim of the work is to draw a mark on where we are nowadays and the future challenges, in order to make passive BCIs closer to being integrated into day-life applications. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.

AB  - With the coming of big data age, dynamic data has gradually appeared in various application fields, such as safety monitoring, financial forecasting, and medical diagnostics. Although existing knowledge discovery and data mining techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, dynamic data has the features of imbalance and instability of data classes, the dynamic change of data volume, which makes it difficult for the classification of dynamic data. To solve these problems, in this paper a robust weighed online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm (RWOSELM) based on the online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm (OSELM) is presented. RWOSELM generates the local dynamic weighted matrix with the help of cost sensitive learning theory, thereby it optimizes the empirical risk of the classification model. Meanwhile, RWOSELM takes the data distribution changes which are caused by temporal properties change of dynamic data into consideration, thus it introduces the forgetting factor to enhance the sensitivity of the classifier to the change of data distribution. The method is able to deal with the data with imbalanced class distribution, and maintains the good robust on dynamic data. This paper tests on 24 datasets with different distribution, and the results show that RWOSELM gets good results on imbalanced dynamic dataset. ©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - With naturalistic dialogue management, a spoken dialogue system behaves as a human would under similar conditions. This paper reports on an experiment to develop naturalistic clarification strategies for noisy speech recognition in the context of spoken dialogue systems. We collected a wizard-of-Oz corpus in which human wizards with access to a rich set of clarification actions made clarification decisions online, based on human-readable versions of system data. The experiment compares an evaluation of calls to a baseline system in a library domain with calls to an enhanced version of the system. The new system has a clarification module based on the wizard data that is a decision tree constructed from three machine-learned models. It replicates the wizards' ability to ground partial understandings of noisy input and to build upon them. The enhanced system has a significantly higher rate of task completion, greater task success and improved efficiency. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - For robust visual tracking, appearance modeling should be able to well separate the object from its backgrounds, while accurately adapt to its appearance variations. However, most of the existing tracking methods mainly focus on one of the two aspects; or design two different modules to combine them with the price of double computational cost. In this paper, by using pairwise metric learning, we present a novel appearance model for robust visual tracking. Specifically, visual tracking is viewed as a pairwise regression problem, and extreme learning machine (ELM) is utilized to construct the pairwise regression framework. In ELM-based pairwise training, two constraints are enforced: the target observations must have different regression outputs from those background ones; while the various target observations during tracking should have approximate regression outputs. Thus, the discriminative and generative capabilities are fully considered in a single object tracking model. Moreover, online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) is used to update the resulting appearance model, thereby leading to a more robust tracking process. Extensive experimental evaluations on challenging video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed tracker. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Learning factories allow both, students and professionals, to learn new approaches in production technology in practice. The transition from manual assembly to hybrid assembly towards an almost fully automated assembly can be arranged in learning factories in a practical way. Hybrid assembly specially shows a lot of potential, as it is designed to be adopted in situations with an increasing number of variants or customized products as well as the need for a scalable production system. In the modern view of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) in hybrid assembly systems, machines or robots are operating hand in hand with the human worker. This paper provides an approach to human-machine centered design of assembly systems and describes their implementation on a case study in the mini-factory laboratory of the Free University of Bolzano. The paper describes a case study, where a previously only manually produced product is produced in a hybrid assembly system in combination with a lightweight robot. As part of the man-machine interaction this work analyses risks for the safety of the human worker and provides appropriate measures. The work finally concludes with a summary and an outlook for the future. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - A control architecture is a key component in the development of an autonomous robot. The control architecture has the goal of accomplishing a mission which can be divided into a set of sequential tasks. This chapter has presented behaviour-based control architectures as a methodology to implement this kind of controller. Its high interaction with the environment, as well as its fast execution and reactivity, are the keys to its success in controlling autonomous robots. The main attention has been given to the coordination methodology. Competitive coordinators assure the robustness of the controller, whereas cooperative coordinators determine the performance of the final robot trajectory. The structure of a control architecture for an autonomous robot has been presented. Two main layers are found in this schema; the deliberative layer which divides the robot mission into a set of tasks, and the behaviour-based layer which is in charge of accomplishing these tasks. This chapter has focused only on the behaviour-based layer. A behaviour coordination approach has been proposed, its main feature being a hybrid coordination of behaviours between competitive and cooperative approaches. A second distinctive part is the use of a learning algorithm to learn the internal mapping between the environment state and the robot actions. Then, the chapter has introduced the main features of the URIS AUV and its experimental set-up. According to the navigation system we have shown that the estimation of the robot position and velocity can be effectively performed with a vision-based system using mosaicking techniques. This approach is feasible when the vehicle navigates near the ocean floor and is also useful to generate a map of the area. Finally, results on real data have been shown through an example in which the behaviour-based layer controlled URIS in a target following task. In these experiments several behaviours were in charge of the control of the robot to avoid obstacles, to find the target and to follow it. One of these behaviours was automatically learnt demonstrating the feasibility of the learning algorithms. Finally, we have also shown the performance of the navigation system using the visual mosaicking techniques. © 2006 The Institution of Electrical Engineers and 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - This work developed and demonstrated a machine learning approach for robust ATR. The primary innovation of this work was the development of an automated way of developing inference rules that can draw on multiple models and multiple feature types to make robust ATR decisions. The key realization is that this "meta learning" problem is one of structural learning, and that it can be conducted independently of parameter learning associated with each model and feature based technique. This was accomplished by using a learning classifier system, which is based on genetics-based machine learning, for the ill conditioned combinatorial problem of structural rule learning, while using statistical and mathematical techniques for parameter learning. This system was tested on MSTAR Public Release SAR data using standard and extended operation conditions. These results were also compared against two baseline classifiers, a PCA based distance classifier and a MSE classifier. The classifiers were evaluated for accuracy (via training set classification) and robustness (via testing set classification). In both cases, the LCS based robust ATR system performed well with accuracy over 99% and robustness over 80%. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An adaptive PID algorithm based on online robust least square support vector machines (LSSVM) was presented to solve the problem of large calculation resulted from the online least support vector machines updating the model in every sampling period. A two-step weights principle was used to improve robustness in LSSVM regression. The predictive error and prior process knowledge were combined to control model complexity. The precision and speed of the LSSVM were improved effectively. Based on the idea of predictive control, the online robust LSSVM modeling algorithm was applied to PID. The results show that the robust cost function combining robust Huber function with ε-insensitive loss function can be used to model for the partial nonlinear region of the system and adaptively identify the model of system with the changing of working point. This algorithm adapts to the control of time-varying parameters object and achieves higher control precision, stronger robustness and modeling speed.

AB  - How can risk analysts help to improve policy and decision making when the correct probabilistic relation between alternative acts and their probable consequences is unknown? This practical challenge of risk management with model uncertainty arises in problems from preparing for climate change to managing emerging diseases to operating complex and hazardous facilities safely. We review constructive methods for robust and adaptive risk analysis under deep uncertainty. These methods are not yet as familiar to many risk analysts as older statistical and model-based methods, such as the paradigm of identifying a single "best-fitting" model and performing sensitivity analyses for its conclusions. They provide genuine breakthroughs for improving predictions and decisions when the correct model is highly uncertain. We demonstrate their potential by summarizing a variety of practical risk management applications. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.

AB  - Addressing the challenge of robust ATR, this paper describes the development and demonstration of Machine Learning for Robust ATR. The primary innovation of this work is the development of an automated way of developing heuristic inference rules that can draw on multiple models and multiple feature types to make more robust ATR decisions. The key realization is that this "meta learning" problem is one of structural learning; that can be conducted independently of parameter learning associated with each model and feature based technique, and more effectively draw on the strengths of all such techniques, and even information from unforeseen techniques. This is accomplished by using robust, genetics-based machine learning for the ill conditioned combinatorial problem of structural rule learning, while using statistical and mathematical techniques for parameter learning. This paper describes a learning classifier system approach (with evolutionary computation for structural learning) for robust ATR and points to a promising solution to the structural learning problem, across multiple feature types (which we will refer to as the meta-learning problem), for ATR with EOCs. This system was tested on MSTAR Public Release SAR data using nominal and extended operation conditions. These results were also compared against two baseline classifiers, a PCA based distance classifier and a MSE classifier. The systems were evaluated for accuracy (via training set classification) and robustness (via testing set classification). In both cases, the LCS based robust ATR system performed very well with accuracy over 99% and robustness over 80%.

AB  - Real-time operation of electric power systems under high penetration of renewable energy generation has to incorporate strategies for managing the uncertainty associated with this type of power sources. In the case of the unit commitment problem, models based on robust optimization have been widely used for the day-ahead computation of power dispatch and reserves schedule. Typical approaches use uncertainty sets with fixed levels of conservativeness, without considering the real-time performance of the solutions. This paper proposes a solution scheme for the adaptive robust unit commitment problem using online adjusted data-driven uncertainty sets. Conservativeness parameters of the uncertainty sets are dynamically calculated as a function of previous operating results and incoming data via reinforcement learning, resulting in an online learning-optimization framework. The paper also develops an experimental framework to simulate real-time operation under the proposed methodology. Out-of-sample experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme against well-known benchmarks with fixed robustness levels. Results show improvements in power generation costs, voltage violations, and use of reserves. Two systems of different sizes are analyzed, illustrating the scalability of the proposed approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The decision-making operational index has been a key issue for achieving safe and optimal operation of industrial processes. Considering the complexity of decision making of multiple operational indices and the uncertainty of production indices caused by changes of working condition in industrial processes, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm with policy asynchronous updating for the first time aiming at self-learning operational indices, followed by the theoretical proof of convergence of the proposed algorithm. To this end, under the framework of stochastic adaptive dynamic programming, the sample mean is utilized rather than calculating the state transition probability matrix of production indices, with the outcome that the state transition probability matrix of production indices is not required to be known a priori. Distinctly from traditional synchronized policy updating, the centralized policy evaluation and asynchronous updating of multiple policies are implemented in the proposed algorithm based on the introduction of a time clock with its threshold, such that solving the concerned decision-making problem of multiple operational indices becomes easier and the learning efficiency of reinforcement learning is improved. Thus, the self-learned operational indices using measured data can ensure the optimality of production indices and limit them within the prescribed range. Experiments are conducted using the real date collected from a large-scale mineral processing plant in west China in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. © 2023 Science Press.

AU  - Tuncel, K.S.

T2  - IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine
AB  - Urban railway systems in many cities are facing increasing levels of crowding and operating near capacity. Crowding at stations and on trains is a concern due to its impact on safety, service quality, and operating efficiency. Denied boarding is becoming a key measure of the impact of near-capacity operations on customers, and it is fundamental for calculating other performance metrics, such as the expected waiting time. Several approaches have been proposed to infer denied boarding using smart card and train movement data. They formulate the inference as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem on observed trip journey times, with an a priori model assumption on independent journey time components, and they require extensive ground truth data collection and model calibration for practical deployment. This article proposes a data-driven unsupervised clustering-based approach to robustly infer denied boarding probabilities for access-plus-waiting times by decomposing trip journey times (instead of directly on journey times). The approach is applicable to closed fare collection systems and consists of two main steps: grouping passengers to trains via trip exit information by using a probabilistic model and inferring denied boarding probabilities by using a structured mixture distribution model with physical constraints and systematic parameter initialization. The method is data driven and requires neither observations of denied boarding nor assumptions about model components&#x2019; independence and parameter calibrations. Case studies validate the proposed method by using actual data and comparing it with state-of-the-art models and survey data. The results demonstrate the proposed model&#x2019;s robustness and applicability for estimating denied boarding under both normal and abnormal operation conditions. IEEE

AB  - We consider a distributed reinforcement learning setting where multiple agents separately explore the environment and communicate their experiences through a central server. However, αfraction of agents are adversarial and can report arbitrary fake information. Critically, these adversarial agents can collude and their fake data can be of any sizes. We desire to robustly identify a near-optimal policy for the underlying Markov decision process in the presence of these adversarial agents. Our main technical contribution is COW, a novel algorithm for the robust mean estimation from batches problem, that can handle arbitrary batch sizes. Building upon this new estimator, in the offline setting, we design a Byzantine-robust distributed pessimistic value iteration algorithm; in the online setting, we design a Byzantine-robust distributed optimistic value iteration algorithm. Both algorithms obtain near-optimal sample complexities and achieve superior robustness guarantee than prior works. Copyright © 2023 by the author(s)

AB  - Proteins often exert their function by binding to other cellular partners. The hot spots are key residues for protein-protein binding. Their identification may shed light on the impact of disease associated mutations on protein complexes and help design protein-protein interaction inhibitors for therapy. Unfortunately, current machine learning methods to predict hot spots, suffer from limitations caused by gross errors in the data matrices. Here, we present a novel data pre-processing pipeline that overcomes this problem by recovering a low rank matrix with reduced noise using Robust Principal Component Analysis. Application to existing databases shows the predictive power of the method. © 2021 The Authors. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Modern power systems are heading towards a sustainable future with rapidly increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics (PV), especially in active distribution networks (ADNs). However, temporal and spatial variations and intermittency of renewable power generation bring challenges on voltage control. As controllable VAR sources, PV associated inverters can supply flexible and fast-responsive reactive power to achieve voltage/VAR control (VVC) in the ADNs. Conventional VVC mainly relies on rule-based, mathematical or heuristic methods, which can be inefficient or even infeasible as the system becomes large and when complex uncertainty conditions are considered. To this end, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization model for the inverter-based VVC under uncertainties. The DRL agent learns to optimally determine inverter reactive power output setpoints through exploration in the virtual environment and neural network training, with multiple objectives of minimizing bus voltage deviations, PV active power curtailments and network power losses. Temporally and spatially uncertain PV power generation and loads are fully considered in the proposed DRL model. A numerical case study on the IEEE 123-bus test system has indicated the VVC decisions are efficiently obtained and are robust against uncertainty realization. © 2020 IEEE

TI  - Real-time well monitoring and engineering analysis of drilling activities: Intelligent rig state detection and prediction with uncertainty
AU  - Kemajou, V.

T2  - Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE
AB  - Drilling activities are risky and costly, especially when performed offshore. Careful monitoring and real time data analysis are required for safe and efficient operations with minimized down-time. Drilling operations, being fast-paced and not visible, often lead to transient and unforeseen issues. The synchronous assessment and prediction of drilling quality has historically been a challenge. It relies on a prompt collection, analysis and prediction of the multiple sensors data, as well as an immediate comparison to the original drilling plan. Another challenge is achieving real-time well engineering, and automatically and instantaneously providing valuable insights to the engineering and operations teams. A system was successfully developed to tackle these challenges. It is a cloud-based application, made with an event-driven streaming architecture to automatically retrieve real-time drilling data and compare it with planned data. The real-time data is automatically made available to determine the current well operation or rig state, and trigger the subsequent engineering analysis. Next, a forecast model is trained with the engineering calculation outputs and it returns predictions on these outputs while considering their inherent uncertainty. As a result, these predictions enable alerts to be sent when the system detects approaching anomalous conditions. The proposed system is a DecisionSpace® 365 cloud-native application on an open architecture. It is flexible, accessible from anywhere, can be automatically updated for continuous improvement, and can be deployed easily and quickly. It can also be extended to further applications.

AB  - This paper presents robust weighted variants of batch and online standard Gaussian processes (GPs) to effectively reduce the negative impact of outliers in the corresponding GP models. This is done by introducing robust data weighers that rely on robust and quasi-robust weight functions that come from robust M-estimators. Our robust GPs are compared to various GP models on four datasets. It is shown that our batch and online robust weighted GPs are indeed robust to outliers, significantly outperforming the corresponding standard GPs and the recently proposed heteroscedastic GP method GPz. Our experiments also show that our methods are comparable to and sometimes better than a state-of-the-art robust GP that uses a Student-t likelihood. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - Chinese Control Conference, CCC
AB  - Recently, the researches on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have attracted tremendous interest in many applications, especially for autonomous driving. The main problem of MARL is how to deal with the uncertainty in the environment and the interaction between the connected agents. To solve the problem, a distributed robust temporal differential deep Q-network algorithm (MARTD-DQN) was developed in this paper. MARTD-DQN consists of two parts, the decentralized MARL algorithm (DMARL) and the robust TD deep Q-network algorithm (RTD-DQN). DMARL improves the robustness of the policy estimation by fusing the states from the neighbors over communicated networks. RTD- DQN improves the robustness to outliers through on-line estimation of the uncertainty. By combining the two algorithms, the proposed algorithm can be robust not only to node failures but also to the outliers. Then the proposed algorithm is applied to ACC simulations of autonomous cars. The simulation results are given to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

TI  - Robust adaptive online sequential extreme learning machine for predicting nonstationary data streams with outliers
AU  - Guo, W.
T2  - Journal of Algorithms and Computational Technology
AB  - Data streams online modeling and prediction is an important research direction in the field of data mining. In practical applications, data streams are often of nonstationary nature and containing outliers, hence an online learning algorithm with dynamic tracking capability as well as anti-outlier capability is urgently needed. With this in mind, this paper proposes a novel robust adaptive online sequential extreme learning machine (RA-OSELM) algorithm for the online modeling and prediction of nonstationary data streams with outliers. The RA-OSELM is developed from the famous online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm, but it uses a more robust M-estimation loss function to replace the conventional least square loss function so as to suppress the incorrect online update of the learning algorithm with respect to outliers, and hence enhances its robustness in the presence of outliers. Moreover, the RA-OSELM adopts a variable forgetting factor method to automatically track the dynamic changes of the nonstationary data streams and timely eliminate the negative impacts of the outdated data, so it tends to produce satisfying tracking results in nonstationary environments. The performances of RA-OSELM are evaluated and compared with other representative algorithms with synthetic and real data sets, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has better adaptive tracking capability with stronger robustness than its counterparts for predicting nonstationary data streams with outliers. © The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning
AU  - Yu, Z.

T2  - Proceedings of Machine Learning Research
AB  - Deep offline reinforcement learning has recently demonstrated considerable promises in leveraging offline datasets, providing high-quality models that significantly reduce the online interactions required for fine-tuning. However, such a benefit is often diminished due to the marked state-action distribution shift, which causes significant bootstrap error and wipes out the good initial policy. Existing solutions resort to constraining the policy shift or balancing the sample replay based on their online-ness. However, they require online estimation of distribution divergence or density ratio. To avoid such complications, we propose deviating from existing actor-critic approaches that directly transfer the state-action value functions. Instead, we post-process them by aligning with the offline learned policy, so that the Q-values for actions outside the offline policy are also tamed. As a result, the online fine-tuning can be simply performed as in the standard actor-critic algorithms. We show empirically that the proposed method improves the performance of the fine-tuned robotic agents on various simulated tasks. © 2023 Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.

TI  - Dispatch Strategy for Transmission Overload Based on Safe Reinforcement Learning
AU  - Zhou, H.
AU  - Zhu, H.

T2  - Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering
AB  - Active power dispatch is one of the major operation tasks for power system that keeps the power generation and consumption in a real-time balance. Real-time decisions for active power dispatch can be seen as a modification on the Day-ahead OPF (DAOPF) and are constrained by power system safety rules. Consequently, active power dispatch focuses mainly on the perspective of operation safety which is influenced by renewable generation power fluctuation, load variation and maintenance. It is impossible to incorporate these stochastic factors in a DAOPF problem. To solve this problem, active power dispatch is formulated into a CMDP problem, where the target is to optimize the dispatch policy that maximize the reward without breaching the safety constraints. Risk of blackout arises from the violation of safety constraints and potential human and property damage would be enormous, which makes the problem different from common RL task. To handle this problem, IPO algorithm, which belongs to safe RL, is adopted. In IEEE 14-bus system, the proposed method is implemented to show the advantages from full aspects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Self-supervised entity alignment (EA) aims to link equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs) without the use of pre-aligned entity pairs. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised EA approach draws inspiration from contrastive learning, originally designed in computer vision based on instance discrimination and contrastive loss, and suffers from two shortcomings. Firstly, it puts unidirectional emphasis on pushing sampled negative entities far away rather than pulling positively aligned pairs close, as is done in the well-established supervised EA. Secondly, it advocates the minimum information requirement for self-supervised EA, while we argue that self-described KG's side information (e.g., entity name, relation name, entity description) shall preferably be explored to the maximum extent for the self-supervised EA task. In this work, we propose an interactive contrastive learning model for self-supervised EA. It conducts bidirectional contrastive learning via building pseudo-aligned entity pairs as pivots to achieve direct cross-KG information interaction. It further exploits the integration of entity textual and structural information and elaborately designs encoders for better utilization in the self-supervised setting. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the previous best self-supervised method by a large margin (over 9% Hits@1 absolute improvement on average) and performs on par with previous SOTA supervised counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interactive contrastive learning for self-supervised EA.

AB  - The application of information technology in many fields is becoming more and more popular, but while bringing about a rapid increase in productivity, it also brings some safety issues, especially in industrial control systems. Since the industrial control system often uses a computer as the control center of some devices, once this computer is attacked, it will cause serious harm. The use of additional security software for security monitoring is not completely credible, after all, security monitoring software will also be attacked and become invalid. Therefore, the method of using some side channels and machine learning is very popular recently, especially the power consumption side channels. However, the power consumption will change with the running time of the device. If the model trained by supervised learning will fail after a few days, this paper proposes a self-learning method based on the power consumption side channel, which can be stable for a long time with a high accuracy of 97%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In modern manufacturing, the interaction and symbiosis between humans and the industrial robot are one of the foci of smart manufacturing. During human-robot interaction(HRI), the potential risk of any injury to workers caused by industrial robots is very critical and should be well-addressed to ensure manufacturing safety. However, in the dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environment, the current HRI safety is still based on the robot's perception of the environment to achieve collision avoidance, lacking adaptable decision-makings under mutual cognition. Therefore, to enhance the cognition of human operators in the working environment and improve the robot's collision avoidance and adaptive motion planning capabilities, this work designs and further implements a mutual cognitive HRI safety system based on augmented reality (AR) in a wearable manner. In the proposed system, the wearable AR device serves as the bridging interface to realize the virtual-real registration of the robot, the virtual-physical mapping of the working environment of the HRI process, and to collect the information of human, robot, and working space. In addition to these, a hierarchical HRI safety strategy is introduced for real-time mutual cognitive assistance to both humans and robots, namely: 1) robot motion speed control and safety area visualization based on human-robot distance, 2) virtual-physical mapping for robot motion preview and collision detection, and 3) deep reinforcement learning-driven motion planning for collision avoidance strategies generation. Lastly, a prototype system is further developed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence and human-robot interaction technologies, it is envisioned this work can bring insightful safety protection mechanisms to better achieve symbiotic human-robot collaboration. © 2023 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB  - A construction site is an open and dynamic space. Construction accidents have been the top-ranked occupational accidents among all industries around the world. Due to the limited quality and quantity of occupational safety supervisors on construction sites, it is difficult to control or prevent risks in real-time. Therefore, a real-time safety warning system based on a deep learning technique (DL) is developed for lifting operations in building construction, called a portable lightweight lifting safety control station (PLSCS). Two modes can be switched manually by the supervisor. If the mode is switched to lifting control mode, PLSCS helps to ensure that nobody is in the hazardous area during lifting operations. The advantages and features of this system are as follows: (1) it warns of the potential safety hazards automatically during the operations; (2) it reduces the workload of occupational safety supervisors; (3) the system is self-powered and easy to carry and deploy. The system was tested and verified in the actual construction site. The results show that the system is useful for improving the safety of lifting operations. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - There is rapid technical progress and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based products and workflows influencing many aspects of human and business activities like banking, healthcare, advertising and many more. Although accuracy of AI models is undoubtedly the most important factor considered while deploying AI based products, there is urgent need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly. Responsible AI is a framework that each software developing organization needs to adapt to build customer trust in the transparency, accountability, fairness, and security of deployed AI solutions. At the same time a key aspect to making AI responsible is to have a development pipeline that can promote reproducibility of results and manage the lineage of data and ML models. This tutorial will throw light on these aspects of Responsible AI with a working example demonstrating the concept. The intent of the tutorial will be to equip the audience with enough knowledge of the concepts along with code to gain appreciation for the importance of building Responsible AI.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) drive biological processes, and disruption of PPIs can cause disease. With recent breakthroughs in structure prediction and a deluge of genomic sequence data, computational methods to predict PPIs and model spatial structures of protein complexes are now approaching the accuracy of experimental approaches for permanent interactions and show promise for elucidating transient interactions. As we describe here, the key to this success is rich evolutionary information deciphered from thousands of homologous sequences that coevolve in interacting partners. This covariation signal, revealed by sophisticated statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms, predicts physiological interactions. Accurate artificial intelligence (AI)-based modeling of protein structures promises to provide accurate 3D models of PPIs at a proteome-wide scale. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Proceedings of Machine Learning Research
AB  - In this paper, we address a safety-critical control problem using reachability analysis and design a reinforcement learning-based mechanism for learning online and in fixed-time the solution to the safety-critical control problem. Safety is assured by determining a set of states for which there does not exist an admissible control law generating a system trajectory reaching a set of forbidden states at a user-prescribed time instant. Specifically, we cast our safety-critical problem as a Mayer optimal feedback control problem whose solution satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and characterizes the set of safe states. Since the HJB equation is generally difficult to solve, we develop an online critic-only reinforcement learning-based algorithm for simultaneously learning the solution to the HJB equation and the safe set in fixed time. In particular, we introduce a non-Lipschitz experience replay-based learning law utilizing recorded and current data for updating the critic weights to learn the value function and the safe set. The non-Lipschitz property of the dynamics gives rise to fixed-time convergence, whereas the experience replay-based approach eliminates the need of satisfying the persistence of excitation condition provided that the recorded data is sufficiently rich. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 N.-M.T. Kokolakis, K.G. Vamvoudakis & W.M. Haddad.

AB  - For industrial human-robot collaboration, the safety issue is the priority during the manufacturing operations. So far, the related researches are mostly limited in utilizing simple thresholds to shift different working modes of industrial robots, and neglect the 3D volume of both human and robot. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to realize the industrial robot real-time collision avoidance and 3D motion planning, in order to facilitate the safety for human-robot collaboration in manufacturing. Concretely, a Markov Decision Process is utilized to formulate the collision avoidance problem as well as the test bench is developed in Robot Operating System. Moreover, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm which operates over continuous action space is used to learn the collision avoidance policy. Finally, the case studies are validated in a virtual environment following with the results showing that the industrial robot can learn the given policy through the proposed algorithm, so as to achieve the safe assurance for industrial human-robot collaboration. © 2019, Computers and Industrial Engineering.

AB  - We propose a benchmark problem for cooperative stochastic games and interactive decision making. The sidewalk problem consists of two agents, each navigating toward their own goal, where the paths of the separate agents intersect. This requires one or both agents to deviate from the optimal path in order to avoid collision. Because both agents are dynamic, there is a need for prediction and/or replanning. We formulate the problem as a stochastic game, and provide details for implementing the problem in both discrete and continuous state and action spaces. We evaluate popular algorithms on variants of the problem, and we discuss generalizations and suggest other benchmark problems for cooperative stochastic games and interactive decision making. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems

AB  - In this paper, we propose a generic framework that enables game developers without knowledge of machine learning to create bot behaviors with playstyles that align with their preferences. Our framework is based on interactive reinforcement learning (RL), and we used it to create a behavior authoring tool called MarioMix. This tool enables non-experts to create bots with varied playstyles for the game titled Super Mario Bros. The main interaction procedure of MarioMix consists of presenting short clips of gameplay displaying precomputed bots with different playstyles to end-users. Then, end-users can select the bot with the playstyle that behaves as intended. We evaluated MarioMix by incorporating input from game designers working in the industry.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) unveils adequate possibilities in the context of demand-oriented qualification of employees. This state-of-the-art technology represents especially for employees an attractive and effective opportunity for the acquisition and transfer of knowledge relating to processes and products [1]. The guiding principle for the application of VR technology in the context of employee qualification consists in a more substantial and sustainable knowledge development if experienced and not abstractly learned using classic learning methods. Virtual learning scenarios, such as for the commissioning or the setting-up of a machine tool, are oriented towards the sensomotoric knowledge development and therefore support the transfer of procedural and action related skills in a virtual training environment. The embedding of learning scenarios in a virtual learning environment, which represents an accessible and realistic depiction of the real work environment as well as the respective work tasks including operating actions, an improved orientation within the real work environment based on the experiences of the virtual world is expected. Apart from a methodological approach for the development of virtual learning scenarios, two defined and developed types of learning scenarios related to the commissioning of a machine tool as well as considering different learning requirements of employee qualification are introduced in this contribution. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

T2  - Risk, Reliability and Sustainable Remediation in the Field of Civil and Environmental Engineering
AB  - Rapid rate of population growth and a subsequent requirement for the transportation and exploitation of land resources for mining purpose has increased tremendously in the recent years. The utilization of underground space has widened with the features of huge, deep, rapid, and dense with most likely the construction of high-rise buildings and tunneling more often involves deep excavation. These operations involve certain risks which have led to the occurrence of various types of accidents which results in loss of human life even with the sophisticated machineries used in the underground construction purpose. The underlying risks associated with the underground operations can be assessed with the aid of engineering characteristics which involve excavation collapse, settlement of ground and pipeline, and the potential hazards to the adjoining structures which needs serious attention toward safety management. Various researchers proposed different techniques in identifying the potential risks in underground construction, their effective management principles, and assessing the potential safety risks in underground operations, which are discussed in this chapter along with their conditions of operation, merits, and demerits and the remedial solutions in overcoming these risks are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - Computational Geosciences
AB  - Production forecasting is a key step to design the future development of a reservoir. A classical way to generate such forecasts consists in simulating future production for numerical models representative of the reservoir. However, identifying such models can be very challenging as they need to be constrained to all available data. In particular, they should reproduce past production data, which requires to solve a complex non-linear inverse problem. In this paper, we thus propose to investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict the future production of a reservoir based on past production data without model calibration. We focus more specifically on robust online aggregation, a deterministic approach that provides a robust framework to make forecasts on a regular basis. This method does not rely on any specific assumption or need for stochastic modeling. Forecasts are first simulated for a set of base reservoir models representing the prior uncertainty and then combined to predict production at the next time step. The weight associated with each forecast is related to its past performance. Three different algorithms are considered for weight computations: the exponentially weighted average algorithm, ridge regression, and the Lasso regression. They are applied to a synthetic reservoir case study, the Brugge case, for sequential predictions. To estimate the potential of development scenarios, production forecasts are needed on long periods of time without intermediary data acquisition. An extension of the deterministic aggregation approach is thus proposed in this paper to provide such multi-step-ahead forecasts. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: This study aims to identify robust radiomic features for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), assess feature selection and machine learning methods for overall survival classification of Glioblastoma multiforme patients, and to robustify models trained on single-center data when applied to multi-center data. Methods: Tumor regions were automatically segmented on MRI data, and 8327 radiomic features extracted from these regions. Single-center data was perturbed to assess radiomic feature robustness, with over 16 million tests of typical perturbations. Robust features were selected based on the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient to measure agreement across perturbations. Feature selectors and machine learning methods were compared to classify overall survival. Models trained on single-center data (63 patients) were tested on multi-center data (76 patients). Priors using feature robustness and clinical knowledge were evaluated. Results: We observed a very large performance drop when applying models trained on single-center on unseen multi-center data, e.g. a decrease of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.56 for the overall survival classification boundary at 1 year. By using robust features alongside priors for two overall survival classes, the AUC drop could be reduced by 21.2%. In contrast, sensitivity was 12.19% lower when applying a prior. Conclusions: Our experiments show that it is possible to attain improved levels of robustness and accuracy when models need to be applied to unseen multi-center data. The performance on multi-center data of models trained on single-center data can be increased by using robust features and introducing prior knowledge. For successful model robustification, tailoring perturbations for robustness testing to the target dataset is key. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Multi-agent reinforcement learning facilitates agents learning to solve complex decision-making problems requiring collaboration. However, reinforcement learning methods are underpinned by stochastic mechanisms, making them unsuitable for safety-critical domains. To solve this issue, approaches such as assured multi-agent reinforcement learning, which utilises quantitative verification to produce formal guarantees of safety requirements during the agents learning process, have been developed. However, this approach relies on accurate knowledge about the environment to be effectively used which can be detrimental if this knowledge is inaccurate. Therefore, we developed an extension to assured multi-agent reinforcement learning called agent interaction driven adaptability, an automated process to securing reliable safety constraints, allowing inaccurate and missing knowledge to be used without detriment. Our preliminary results showcase the ability of agent interaction driven adaptability to allow safe multi-agent reinforcement learning to be utilised in safety-critical scenarios. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Multi-modal neural machine translation (MNMT) aims to improve textual level machine translation performance in the presence of text-related images. Most of the previous works on MNMT focus on multi-modal fusion methods with full visual features. However, text and its corresponding image may not match exactly, visual noise is generally inevitable. The irrelevant image regions may mislead or distract the textual attention and cause model performance degradation. This paper proposes a noise-robust multi-modal interactive fusion approach with cross-modal relation-aware mask mechanism for MNMT. A text-image relation-aware attention module is constructed through the cross-modal interaction mask mechanism, and visual features are extracted based on the text-image interaction mask knowledge. Then a noise-robust multi-modal adaptive fusion approach is presented by fusion the relevant visual and textual features for machine translation. We validate our method on the Multi30K dataset. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model, and achieve the state-of-the-art scores in all En-De, En-Fr and En-Cs translation tasks © 2022 Proceedings - International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING.

AB  - As we all know, online businesses are growing in popularity by the day, and the need for websites to attract more clients and provide them with the best possible service should be ensured for all. In this regard, we have come up with a concept for client categorization. Customers who buy items frequently online will be in the platinum group, followed by consumers who buy products occasionally online, who will be in the gold group, and finally, customers who buy products extremely seldom online, who will be in the silver group. We used the data evolution method to collect data from a Google Form in this study. We have set an age limit to ensure that everyone gets the information they need. We have also included a few key professions so that you may learn from those experts and their important info. There were 531 responders in all, with 57 percent of females and 43 percent of males. We assemble data leveling with the guidance of e-commerce business experts to identify customers as Silver, Gold, or Platinum depending on the frequency of their purchases, shopping intervals, and expenses. After labeling data, Machine learning approaches are established for data analysis. Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Nave Bayes Classifier (NBC), Logistic Regression (LR), Instance Based-K, Logistic Model Tree, J-48, J-Rip, and PART those models are developed to classify the online consumer. For classification, the random forest classifier (RFC) technique performs very well with 94.34% accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, combustion instability has been diagnosed by performing machine learning using the flame images measured from a model gas turbine combustor. The images were acquired with an ultra-high-speed camera at the rate of 8 kHz in the transition condition of combustion instability from stable to unstable regimes. To judge the onset of combustion instability, two machine learning models of CNN and CNN+LSTM were developed and applied, and their diagnostic performances were evaluated using confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score. It was confirmed that the CNN model performs partially inaccurate classification with an accuracy of 48.92~100% because it was trained and judges with only a single image, whereas the CNN+LSTM model, which uses time-series flame image data, performs very accurate classification with an accuracy of 98.97~100%.  © 2021 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Reinforcement learning refers to a machine learning paradigm in which an agent interacts with the environment to learn how to perform a task. The characteristics of the environment may change over time or be affected by disturbances not controlled, avoiding the agent finding a proper policy. Some approaches attempt to address these problems, as interactive reinforcement learning, where an external entity helps the agent learn through advice. Other approaches, such as robust reinforcement learning, allow the agent to learn the task, acting in a disturbed environment. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses interactive reinforcement learning problems in a dynamic environment, where advice provides information on the task and the dynamics of the environment. Thus, an agent learns a policy in a disturbed environment while receiving advice. We implement our approach in the dynamic version of the cart-pole balancing task and a simulated robotic arm dynamic environment to organize objects. Our results show that the proposed approach allows an agent to complete the task satisfactorily in a dynamic, continuous state-action domain. Moreover, experimental results suggest agents trained with our approach are less sensitive to changes in the characteristics of the environment than interactive reinforcement learning agents.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of underground engineering in China, more metro tunnels are being constructed, the mileage of subway tunnels is increasing, and the corresponding problems of tunnel structure diseases are becoming more prominent. At present, the treatment of tunnel structural diseases mainly relies on manual inspection and identification, and research on defects prediction is still lacking. Because of the complexity of the factors affecting tunnel structure diseases, it is difficult to analyze the causes and development trend of the diseases comprehensively by manual analysis. Fortunately, machine learning methods have gained popularity in classification and regression tasks in recent decades. Many algorithms, such as decision tree algorithms, the random forest algorithm, and XGBoost, have been applied in fields including finance, engineering, and transportation. This study aimed to analyze the prediction effect of machine learning models by feeding 68055 segment lining rings of six subway lines in a city. According to the disease records from 2014 to 2016 and the corresponding convergence and characteristic data, defect conditions in 2017 were predicted and compared with real defect conditions in 2017. The accuracy rates and F1 values of the predicted results were all above 80%. The prediction results can help tunnel maintenance departments and relevant government regulators make auxiliary decisions to control tunnel structure diseases, and can help them focus on the tunnel interval of severe diseases to clarify the development trend of tunnel disease. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) has received interest within the context of decision making under uncertainty in the process industries. The primary benefit of RL arises from the formulation of the control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), meaning that it inherits the benefits of accounting for uncertainty in a closed loop feedback control framework and models dynamics very generally via conditional probability density functions. This enables RL to handle problems with various types of exogenous and endogenous uncertainties. Despite this there has been little reported uptake of RL in the process industries. This is partly due to the inability to provide optimality guarantees under the model used for learning, but more importantly due to safety concerns. This has led to the development of RL algorithms in the context of ‘Safe RL’. Here, we present an algorithm that leverages the variance prediction of Gaussian process state space models to a) handle operational constraints and b) account for mismatch between the offline process model and the real online process. The algorithm is then benchmarked on an uncertain Lutein photo-production process against nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and several state-of-the-art Safe RL algorithms. Through definition of key performance indicators, we demonstrate the efficacy of the method with respect to objective performance and probabilistic constraint satisfaction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chat-logs are informative digital footprints available on Social Media Platforms (SMPs). With the rise of cybercrimes targeting children, chat-logs can be used to discover and flag harmful behaviour for the attention of law enforcement units. This can make an important contribution to the safety of minors on SMPs from being exploited by online predators. The problem is that digital forensic investigation is mostly manual. Thus, a daunting task for forensic investigators because of the sheer volume and variety of data. The solution that is proposed in this paper employs a Digital Forensic Process Model that is supported by Machine Learning (ML) methods to facilitate the automatic discovery of harmful conversations in chat-logs. ML has already been successfully applied in the domain of text analysis for the discovery of online sexual predatory chats. However, there is an absence of approaches that show how ML can contribute to a digital forensic investigation. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to indicate how the tasks in a digital forensic investigation process can be organised so to obtain useable ML results when investigating online predators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Robust unsupervised learning of temporal dynamic interactions is an important problem in robotic learning in general and automated unsupervised learning in particular. Temporal dynamic interactions can be described by (multiple) geometric trajectories in a suitable space over which unsupervised learning techniques may be applied to extract useful features from raw and high-dimensional data measurements. Taking a geometric approach to robust unsupervised learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to develop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for assessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method concerning its tuning parameters. Such metrics must account for (geometric) constraints in the physical world as well as uncertainties associated with the learned patterns. In this paper, we introduce a model-free metric based on the Procrustes distance for robust learning of dynamic vehicle interactions, and an optimal transport-based distance metric for comparing between distributions of interaction patterns. These distance metrics can serve as an objective for assessing the stability of an interaction learning algorithm. They are also used for comparing the outcomes produced by different algorithms. Moreover, they may also be adopted as an objective function to obtain clusters and representative interaction primitives. These concepts and techniques will be introduced, along with mathematical properties, while their usefulness will be demonstrated in unsupervised learning of vehicle-to-vehicle interactions extracted from the Safety Pilot database, one of the world's largest databases for connected vehicles. Results reveal that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques under several well-founded notions of clustering efficiencies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present scTenifoldXct, a semi-supervised computational tool for detecting ligand-receptor (LR)-mediated cell-cell interactions and mapping cellular communication graphs. Our method is based on manifold alignment, using LR pairs as inter-data correspondences to embed ligand and receptor genes expressed in interacting cells into a unified latent space. Neural networks are employed to minimize the distance between corresponding genes while preserving the structure of gene regression networks. We apply scTenifoldXct to real datasets for testing and demonstrate that our method detects interactions with high consistency compared with other methods. More importantly, scTenifoldXct uncovers weak but biologically relevant interactions overlooked by other methods. We also demonstrate how scTenifoldXct can be used to compare different samples, such as healthy vs. diseased and wild type vs. knockout, to identify differential interactions, thereby revealing functional implications associated with changes in cellular communication status.

AB  - The reliability problems caused by random failure or malicious attacks in the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly severe, while a highly robust network topology is the basis for highly reliable Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, improving the robustness of the IoT against cyber-attacks by optimizing the network topology becomes a vital issue. Heuristic algorithms as the mainstream idea to solve the network robustness optimization, but their high computational cost cannot meet the timeliness requirements of real IoT scenarios. This paper proposes a Smart Topology Robustness Optimization (SmartTRO) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). First, we design a rewiring operation as an evolutionary behavior in IoT network topology robustness optimization, which achieves topology optimization at a low cost without changing the degree of all nodes. Then, SmartTRO learns the evolutionary behavior characteristics of IoT network topology by combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and policy network, where the training of neural network parameters is completed by DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartTRO improves the ability of IoT topology to resist cyber-attacks effectively and outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm in terms of both topology robustness optimization performance and computational cost. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We collected Instagram data from 150 adolescents (ages 13-21) that included 15,547 private message conversations of which 326 conversations were flagged as sexually risky by participants. Based on this data, we leveraged a human-centered machine learning approach to create sexual risk detection classifiers for youth social media conversations. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forest models outperformed in identifying sexual risks at the conversation-level (AUC=0.88), and CNN outperformed at the message-level (AUC=0.85). We also trained classifiers to detect the severity risk level (i.e., safe, low, medium-high) of a given message with CNN outperforming other models (AUC=0.88). A feature analysis yielded deeper insights into patterns found within sexually safe versus unsafe conversations. We found that contextual features (e.g., age, gender, and relationship type) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) contributed the most for accurately detecting sexual conversations that made youth feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Our analysis provides insights into the important factors and contextual features that enhance automated detection of sexual risks within youths' private conversations. As such, we make valuable contributions to the computational risk detection and adolescent online safety literature through our human-centered approach of collecting and ground truth coding private social media conversations of youth for the purpose of risk classification.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - In Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) mission that committed to empower employees with the needed capabilities and fuel innovation, efficiency and more importantly achieve and sustain a 100% Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), by transforming the way of handling HSE events by moving from reactive to proactive approach. Drilling operations represent a challenging environment due to human factors that prone focusing on operations mainly instead of safety of Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE). Surveillance cameras are installed in various locations in rig floor and contribute to security and safety. However, the current methods of video analytic in floor rigs are weak in the long-term sequence of nodes with missing and abnormal error value such nighttime, low illumination which causes poor images. In a proof-of-concept exercise, PDO has been provided the AI Solution to overcome all above limitation to develop AI Models based on drilling operation on rig floor. Consequently, this paper presents machine learning pipeline that is validated and evaluated the vendors Video AI detection of HSE violations of PPE and restricted zone access on the rig floor that shared video dataset. The pipeline can be described in two parts. Due to the complexity of the use case that usually difficult to be managed in-house, we propose a method to bring different algorithms solutions from different vendors where the evaluation is managed in-house. In this, we present a framework for video analytic evaluating safety operation drilling in floor rigs. This framework contains the data of video source that collected, annotations guidelines to support necessary data quantities for the best machine learning approaches, performance metrics, and tools that containing scoring baseline models to be able compute amazing performance output regarding annotated ground truth data. The benefit of this study was to address some challenges of video object analytic and tracking beyond evaluation framework that enables a significant comparison of Machine learning models, provides AI vendors with sufficient data for the exploration the automatic modeling approaches, encourages the incorporation evaluation the techniques with process development, and contributes valuable oil and gas drilling that will demonstrate very useful to Computer Vision (CV) research for next years.

T2  - Computer Aided Chemical Engineering
AB  - This work studies reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of multi-period supply chains subject to constraints, e.g., on inventory. We introduce Distributional Constrained Policy Optimization (DCPO), a novel approach for reliable constraint satisfaction in RL. Our approach is based on Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), which is subject to approximation errors that in practice lead it to converge to infeasible policies. We address this issue by incorporating aspects of distributional RL. Using a supply chain case study, we show that DCPO improves the rate at which the RL policy converges and ensures reliable constraint satisfaction by the end of training. The proposed method also greatly reduces the variance of returns between runs; this result is significant in the context of policy gradient methods, which intrinsically introduce high variance during training. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We examine online safe multi-agent reinforcement learning using constrained Markov games in which agents compete by maximizing their expected total rewards under a constraint on expected total utilities. Our focus is confined to an episodic two-player zero-sum constrained Markov game with independent transition functions that are unknown to agents, adversarial reward functions, and stochastic utility functions. For such a Markov game, we employ an approach based on the occupancy measure to formulate it as an online constrained saddle-point problem with an explicit constraint. We extend the Lagrange multiplier method in constrained optimization to handle the constraint by creating a generalized Lagrangian with minimax decision primal variables and a dual variable. Next, we develop an upper confidence reinforcement learning algorithm to solve this Lagrangian problem while balancing exploration and exploitation. Our algorithm updates the minimax decision primal variables via online mirror descent and the dual variable via projected gradient step and we prove that it enjoys sublinear rate O((|X| + |Y |)LpT(|A| + |B|))) for both regret and constraint violation after playing T episodes of the game. Here, L is the horizon of each episode, (|X|, |A|) and (|Y |, |B|) are the state/action space sizes of the min-player and the max-player, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first provably efficient online safe reinforcement learning algorithm in constrained Markov games. © 2023 D. Ding, X. Wei, Z. Yang, Z. Wang & M.R.

AB  - Cyber-abuse against women has become a pervasive issue in today's digital age, posing serious threats to their safety and well-being. To combat this problem, proposed an ensemble learning model approach in machine learning technology that aims to detect and abort instances of cyber-abuse targeting women on online platforms. The proposed model combines the machine learning techniques of both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to enhance performance and generalization. An ensemble model is constructed by combining the predictions of individual base models using aggregation techniques such as LightGBM (Light Gradient Machines). The trained ensemble learning model is integrated into a real-time monitoring system that continuously analyses social media content. This system identifies and flags potentially abusive or harassing content directed towards women. Combining technological advancements, human expertise, and community engagement, our ensemble learning model approach offers a comprehensive solution to predict and prevent cyber abuse against women, fostering safer and more inclusive online spaces. Additionally, our course emphasizes the importance of jurisdictional considerations and punitive measures implemented in different jurisdictions. © by the author(s).

AB  - Construction equipment operators are at risk of mental fatigue, which can lead to accidents and health problems. Real-time monitoring is necessary to prevent accidents and protect operators' well-being. Previous studies have used wearable sensors to classify mental fatigue in operators, but these methods require physical sensors to be worn, causing discomfort and irritation. Therefore, a new approach is needed that allows for contactless measurements of mental fatigue. In this study, a novel approach was proposed using machine learning and geometric measurement of facial features to classify mental fatigue states during equipment operations. Video recordings were obtained during a one-hour excavation operation, and four facial features (eye distance, eye aspect ratio, head motion, and mouth aspect ratio) were extracted for analysis. The temporal increase in NASA-TLX score was used as the ground truth for mental fatigue. The results showed that the support vector machine classifier outperformed, achieving a high accuracy of 91.10% and an F1 score between 85.29% and 95.61%. These findings suggest that mental fatigue in construction equipment operators can be non-invasively monitored using geometric measurements of facial features. © 2023 by CITC-13.
